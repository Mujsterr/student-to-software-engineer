# 7.1.1. Understand Your Audience

Before you worry about actually writing your resume, you need to understand who you’re writing your resume for.

There are typically two types of people who will be reading your resume:

## 1. Human Resources / Talent Acquisition

These are recruiters and HR staff. They’re often the first to see your resume, and they usually aren’t engineers themselves. Their job is to screen candidates based on:

- Keywords that match the job description
- Clear signs of relevant experience or education
- General polish and professionalism

For this audience, your resume should be:

Easy to scan (clear headings, consistent formatting, short bullet points)

Buzzword-friendly (mention relevant languages, tools, and frameworks)

Free of fluff (no vague claims or dense paragraphs)

## 2. Engineering Managers / Developers

If your resume passes the first screen, it may land in front of a technical person. This audience actually understands what you built and will assess:

- Technical depth: Do your projects or experience show real understanding?

- Problem-solving ability: Can you think critically, ship things, and write code?

- Initiative and impact: Did you just follow tutorials, or did you solve real problems?

For this audience, your resume should:

- Show real projects with clear scope, your role, and measurable impact

- Avoid over-exaggeration — engineers can tell if you’re inflating your contributions

Demonstrate competence, even if you haven’t held a formal job yet
