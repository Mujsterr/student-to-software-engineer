# 7.1.2.1. Header

The header of your resume is the first thing employers see, so it should be clear and professional.

Include your name, contact information (email, phone), and links to relevant profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal website).

I do not personally include a physical address in my header, as it is not relevant to most employers and can take up valuable space. If an office is located in a specific city, the employer will likely assume you are located in that city or are willing to relocate.
