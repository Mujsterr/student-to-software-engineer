# 7.1.1. When to Search

Starting your job search too late can mean missing out on the best opportunities.

A good rule of thumb is to start searching **one semester before** your desired internship term. For example:

- **Fall internships** → Start looking in **Spring** (around **May**)
- **Winter internships** → Start looking in **Fall** (around **September**)
- **Summer internships** → Start looking in **Fall** (as early as August, especially for big tech, but around **January** for local companies)

For **summer internships**, large tech companies often open applications as early as **August of the previous year**. Smaller companies and startups tend to post roles closer to the start date, often around **January** or later, especially if they’re local and not part of a major tech hub.

Keep in mind that North American universities operate on different academic calendars—some use **semesters (three terms)** while others use **quarters (four terms)**—so adjust your timeline accordingly.
