# 4.6. The Software Development Lifecycle

The kind of work you do as a software engineer will depend on where you are in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

The SDLC is a framework that describes the stages of software development, from initial concept to deployment and maintenance.

The SDLC will vary depending on the team and project, but it generally includes the atleast following stages:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understanding what the software needs to do, often through meetings with stakeholders, users, and product managers.
2. **Design**: Creating a blueprint for how the software will be structured, including architecture, user interfaces, and data models.
3. **Implementation**: Writing, testing, and integrating code to build the software according to the design specifications.
4. **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates to fix bugs, add features, and ensure the software continues to meet user needs.

Your client, product manager, business analyst, or designer, will often take on the requirements gathering and design stages, while you will be more involved in the implementation and maintenance stages.

The SDLC is not always linear, and teams often iterate on earlier stages based on feedback and changing requirements. This is especially true in Agile environments, where the focus is on delivering small increments of value quickly and adapting to change.

### How the SDLC Affects Those Early in Their Career

If you are a new developer joining a project half way through the SDLC, you will find yourself feeling "lost" at first.

This is normal, and it can take time to get up to speed. You have to understand that the other members of your team have been working on the project for a while, and have already had time to familiarize themselves with the business context and design decisions being made before you joined.

To help you get up to speed, you should:

- **Ask Questions**: Don’t be afraid to ask your team members for clarification on the project, the design decisions, and the business context. They will appreciate your curiosity and willingness to learn.
- **Read Documentation**: If your team has documentation, read it! It can provide valuable context and help you understand the project’s history and goals.
- **Pair with Experienced Developers**: Pair programming or shadowing more experienced developers can help you learn the codebase and understand how the project fits into the larger SDLC.
- **Take Small Steps**: Start with small tasks or bugs to get familiar with the codebase and the team’s workflow. As you gain confidence, you can take on larger features or more complex tasks.
- **Be Patient**: It takes time to understand a new project, especially if you’re joining it partway through the SDLC. Be patient with yourself and give yourself time to learn.
