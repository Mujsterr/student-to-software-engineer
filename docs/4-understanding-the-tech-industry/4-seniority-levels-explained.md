# 4.4. Seniority Levels Explained

In tech, titles like _junior_, _senior_, or _staff engineer_ get thrown around a lot—but what do they really mean?

Seniority in software development isn’t just about how long you’ve been working. It’s about your level of responsibility, independence, and the type of problems you’re trusted to solve.

This section breaks down the typical **individual contributor (IC)** career ladder, as well as the **engineering management** path, so you can understand where you are—and where you might want to go.

## Junior Developer

**What it means:**
You're early in your career—either just graduated, in your first or second role, or still learning the ropes.

**What you’re expected to do:**

- Write and debug code under close guidance
- Learn tools, workflows, and team conventions
- Ask a lot of questions and absorb feedback
- Contribute to small features or bug fixes

**What you’re _not_ expected to do:**

- Make architectural decisions
- Independently own large features
- Mentor others

**Goal:**
Grow your skills, gain confidence writing production code, and become a reliable team member.

## Intermediate Developer

**What it means:**
You’ve got a few years of experience, and you can now work more independently.

**What you’re expected to do:**

- Own small-to-medium features from start to finish
- Review peers' code and give helpful feedback
- Understand the codebase and how it fits into the product
- Troubleshoot moderately complex issues

**What sets you apart:**
You’re no longer just executing tasks—you’re starting to _make decisions_, raise concerns, and contribute to improving the team’s workflow.

**Goal:**
Build toward being a person others rely on to keep things moving.

## Senior Developer

**What it means:**
You're a technical leader within your team. You have deep knowledge in specific areas and are trusted to solve complex problems.

**What you’re expected to do:**

- Design and implement large features or systems
- Unblock teammates and mentor junior/intermediate devs
- Anticipate edge cases and long-term technical debt
- Make tradeoffs and justify technical decisions

**The real difference:**
You aren’t just _writing code_—you’re helping others succeed, improving systems, and making long-term contributions.

**Goal:**
Lead by example, solve hard problems, and elevate the team.

## Staff Developer and the IC Track

**What it means:**
You’ve advanced beyond the senior level, but you’re still focused on _building_, not managing. Staff, Principal, and Distinguished Engineers all sit on the **Individual Contributor (IC) track**.

**At this level, you might:**

- Set technical direction across multiple teams
- Lead architectural reviews and system redesigns
- Act as a go-to expert for critical areas
- Influence company-wide engineering practices

**You're valued for:**
Your technical depth, judgment, and ability to solve _organization-level_ problems—not just team-level ones.

**Goal:**
Scale your impact through deep expertise, long-term thinking, and technical leadership.

## Engineering Manager and the Management Track

**What it means:**
Instead of advancing through technical depth, you’ve chosen to lead _people_.

**Engineering managers:**

- Run 1-on-1s, performance reviews, and hiring
- Remove roadblocks for their team
- Align team priorities with company goals
- Foster growth and well-being of their developers

At higher levels, the track continues to **Director → VP → CTO**, with increasing responsibility over teams, departments, and strategic decisions.

**Important note:**
Management is not “above” senior or staff developers. It’s a _parallel_ track. Some senior engineers choose to stay technical; others become managers.

**Goal:**
Help your team thrive and deliver great software by building a healthy, productive environment.
