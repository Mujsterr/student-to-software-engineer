# 4.8. The Dream Company Fallacy

You’re going to hear this a lot:

- “I want to work at Google.”
- “My dream is to get into FAANG.”
- “If I could just get into [insert prestigious company here], I’d be set.”

This mindset is extremely common—especially among students or early-career developers. It’s easy to see why. Big names like Google, Meta, or Amazon are associated with prestige, cutting-edge technology, and world-class talent. But here’s the truth:

The company name on your resume **matters far less** than the people you work with and the work you do every day.

When someone says “I want to work at Google,” I usually ask, _“What do you want to do at Google?”_
Most of the time, they don’t know. They’ve never worked in tech. They’ve never worked on a n engineering team. They just know that Google sounds impressive.

This isn’t judgment—this is inexperience. And it’s totally normal. But if you never question this dream, it can become a distraction.

## Why Do You _Really_ Want to Work at a “Dream Company”?

If you dig a little deeper, most students aren’t actually chasing the company itself—they’re chasing the idea of what they think it represents.

What people usually mean when they say they want to work at FAANG is:

- “I want to work on interesting and meaningful problems.”
- “I want to be surrounded by smart people who challenge me.”
- “I want strong mentorship and career growth opportunities.”
- “I want to be paid well and treated with respect.”
- “I want a workplace that values innovation.”

Those are great goals. But none of them are exclusive to FAANG. Many startups, mid-sized companies, and even government agencies can offer all of those things—and sometimes do a better job of it, especially when it comes to mentorship and scope of impact.

## The Danger of the Dream

Fixating on a single “dream company” can be limiting, discouraging, and misleading. Here's why:

### 1. **You Might Miss Out on Better Opportunities**

Some of the best jobs in tech aren’t at household names. There are smaller companies where you'll get more ownership, better mentorship, and more responsibility early on. You might learn faster and grow more quickly than you would in a giant org where you’re one of hundreds of engineers.

### 2. **You’re Chasing an Idea, Not a Reality**

Most students have no idea what it’s actually like to work at their “dream company.” Every company—no matter how famous—has teams with bad managers, bureaucratic blockers, and internal politics. The name alone doesn’t guarantee a good experience.

### 3. **It Can Create False Narratives of Success**

If you start to believe that your career is only successful if you land a FAANG job, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. Great careers are built on continuous learning, meaningful work, and good teammates—not just logos.

## That Said… Prestige _Does_ Have Value

Let’s be real: getting into a well-known company _can_ be a career accelerator. There are two main reasons:

### 1. **Resume Signaling**

Having a brand-name company on your resume makes you look more credible to recruiters. It suggests you passed a difficult interview process, worked with high-caliber peers, and survived in a fast-paced environment. It makes it easier to get interviews at other places.

### 2. **Exposure to Large-Scale Problems**

Big tech companies operate at a scale that few others ever reach. This often means tackling problems that haven’t been solved before.

In contrast, at many smaller companies, you might find yourself mimicking what industry leaders are already doing—rebuilding existing solutions rather than inventing new ones.

Even if you don’t stay at a big company forever, this kind of hands-on experience can shape how you think about systems and scalability for the rest of your career.

## What You Should Focus On Instead

Rather than idolizing a specific company, ask yourself questions like:

- What kind of problems do I want to solve?
- What tools, languages, or domains excite me?
- What work culture fits me best?
- What kind of mentorship or autonomy do I want?

If you focus on _what you want to do_ and _who you want to become_, you’ll make better career decisions than if you just focus on _where you want to work_.

## TL;DR

Dream companies are often just symbols for the kind of work and growth students want. It’s totally fine to apply to them, but don’t confuse the brand with the job.
The best job for you might be at a company you've never heard of—on a team that makes you better, values your contributions, and helps you grow.

Choose people and problems, not prestige.
