# 4.1. Workplace Variables

Like all jobs, being a software engineer is not a single destination. The truth is that this role looks wildly different depending on where you land.

It's important you are aware of the variables that shape your workplace because your job is going to take up a significant portion of your life. Not just in terms of hours—but also your focus, your energy, and in many cases, your sense of identity.

## Workplace Variables

There are many variables that shape your experience as a software engineer, and they can have a huge impact on your day-to-day life. Understanding these variables can help you make informed decisions about where to work and what kind of environment will suit you best.

### Organization Size

A small startup with ten people will have a very different culture and workflow than a large enterprise with thousands of employees.

Large companies often have more bureaucracy, established processes, and specialized roles. Startups tend to be more flexible, with less defined roles that require you to wear many hats.

For those early in their careers, wearing many hats is a great way to learn quickly, but larger organizations also offer more challenging problems that can help you grow in different ways.

### Technical vs Non-Technical Organizations

For a government department or bank, tech is often a support function, while in a tech company, it’s the core of the business.

Tech companies have a culture that usually aligns more closely with that of software engineers, while non-tech companies might have a more traditional corporate culture that can feel out of place.

### Corporate Values

Some companies prioritize innovation and speed, while others focus on stability and compliance. Your values might align with one company but clash with another.

### Market, Mission, and Industry

The market you operate in can greatly affect your work. Working in health tech, fintech, gaming, or e-commerce means interacting with different kinds of customers and business models. Each industry has its own pace, expectations, and challenges.

Working on a payments system requires a different level of security and compliance than building a social media app.

### Your Client

Is your client an end user, another internal team, or a business partner? Are you B2B or B2C? The nature of your client will shape your priorities and how you measure success.

If you're working directly on a product, you might have more opportunities to interact with users and understand their needs.

If you're building internal tools or infrastructure, your "client" might be another team within the company, which can lead to different kinds of feedback and requirements.

If you're in a B2B environment, you might be dealing with larger clients and longer sales cycles, which can affect how you prioritize features and stability.

B2B products often require more rigorous testing and compliance, while B2C products might prioritize speed and user experience.

B2B companies often have more stability as they focus on long-term contracts and relationships, while B2C companies might be more volatile as they chase user growth and engagement.

### The Project

The specific project you work on can greatly affect your day-to-day experience. A public-facing mobile app will have different pressures and workflows than internal tools or backend systems.

Sometimes you'll be working on a greenfield project, building something from scratch. Other times, you might be maintaining or improving an existing system that has its own quirks and challenges.

Sometimes the software you build is customer-facing, which means you need to prioritize user experience, performance, and reliability. Other times, you're building internal tools that might not have the same level of scrutiny but still need to be functional and efficient.

Sometimes the software you build has a different release cycle, a SAAS product might have a continuous deployment model, while an enterprise application might have quarterly releases. This affects how you plan your work, test your code, and deliver features.

Sometimes the software you build is a critical part of the business, like a payment processing system or a customer relationship management tool. Other times, it might be a less critical feature that still needs to be done well but doesn't have the same level of visibility.

What is the scope of your project? Are you working on a small feature, a large system overhaul, or something in between? The scope will affect your timelines, resources, and the complexity of the work. Projects with tight deadlines might require you to prioritize speed over quality, while longer-term projects can allow for more thorough testing and refinement.

### Technology Stack

The languages, frameworks, and tools your team uses will shape your workflow and learning opportunities. Some stacks are more modern and flexible, while others are legacy systems that require specialized knowledge.

### Team Structure

The dynamics of your team can make or break your experience. Some teams are collaborative and supportive, while others are siloed or dysfunctional.

Is your team cross-functional, with designers, product managers, and engineers working closely together? Or is it more siloed, with each role working independently?

Can developers on your team do any kind of work, or do you have specialized roles like frontend, backend, or DevOps?

### The People Around You

Your colleagues, managers, and mentors will shape your experience. Some teams have strong mentorship and onboarding systems, while others throw you into the deep end.

How many senior engineers are on your team? Are they willing to mentor you, or are they too busy with their own work?

How many business stakeholders are involved in your projects? Do they understand the technical challenges, or do they have unrealistic expectations?

Do the people around you share your values and work ethic? Are they supportive, or do they create a toxic environment?

Does your product manager understand technical constraints, or do they push for unrealistic deadlines?

Is your manager supportive and invested in your growth, or are they more focused on meeting deadlines and hitting targets?

### Team Rituals and Processes

How your team communicates, collaborates, and manages work can greatly affect your productivity and job satisfaction. Some teams have well-defined processes, while others are more chaotic.

How often do you have stand-ups, retrospectives, and planning meetings? Do you use Agile methodologies, or is it more ad-hoc?

## Navigating the Landscape

Understanding these variables is crucial for navigating the tech job market. It helps you identify what kind of work environment will suit you best and what to look for in a job.

When you're applying for jobs, consider how these factors align with your values and career goals. Do you thrive in a fast-paced startup environment, or do you prefer the stability of a large corporation? Are you excited about working on cutting-edge technology, or do you find satisfaction in maintaining and improving existing systems?

You might not get full control over where you land, especially early on. But the more you understand the different shapes that “software engineer” can take, the better you can navigate the job market, advocate for yourself, and build a career that aligns with the kind of life you actually want.
