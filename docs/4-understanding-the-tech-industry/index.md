# 4. Understanding the Workplace

Your job is going to take up a significant portion of your life. Not just in terms of hours—but also your focus, your energy, and in many cases, your sense of identity. And while school often treats “software engineer” as a single destination, the truth is that this role looks wildly different depending on where you land.

A software job at a ten-person startup is not the same as one at a 5,000-person enterprise. A front-end developer working on a public-facing mobile app will have a very different experience from someone building internal tooling or backend systems for internal teams. Even within the same company, two people with the same title might have completely different workflows, pressures, and expectations.

University doesn't really prepare you for this. Most of your experience comes from solving isolated problems on your own or with a few classmates. You don’t deal with real deadlines, product requirements, cross-functional collaboration, or the experience of working in a codebase that hundreds of other people are touching every day. School projects are short, often built from scratch, and rarely maintained. At work, you're more likely to inherit something built years ago, with quirks and compromises no one remembers the reason for.

The people around you also make a huge difference. Some teams are tightly knit, collaborative, and supportive. Others are dysfunctional, overly siloed, or constantly behind schedule. Some companies have mentorship and onboarding systems that ease you into your role. Others throw you into the deep end and expect you to figure it out on your own. It’s not always easy to tell from the outside what you’re walking into—but learning to ask the right questions and understanding what matters to you (and what doesn’t) can make a big difference in how satisfied you are at work.

Then there’s the industry itself. Working in health tech, fintech, gaming, e-commerce, or enterprise SaaS means interacting with different kinds of customers, business models, and expectations. Some industries move fast and break things. Others prioritize stability, compliance, or reliability. In some places, engineers talk directly to users. In others, your “customer” might be another internal team.

All of this means that your first job will shape not just what you learn, but how you think about work and what kind of developer you become. That’s not to say you need to find the perfect company or perfect team right away. But it’s worth understanding what kinds of environments exist—and what tradeoffs come with each.

You might not get full control over where you land, especially early on. But the more you understand the different shapes that “software engineer” can take, the better you can navigate the job market, advocate for yourself, and build a career that aligns with the kind of life you actually want.
