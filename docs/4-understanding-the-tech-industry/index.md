# 4. Understanding The Workplace

As explained in chapter 1.1, Software engineers build, test, and maintain software systems.

But what does a typical day look like? Who do you work with? And how does it all fit into the larger tech industry?

In this chapter, we’ll explore the aspects that shape your workplace as a software engineer, the different roles you might encounter, and how to navigate the tech industry effectively.

## What It's Like Being a Software Engineer

A software engineer’s day-to-day can vary widely depending on the company, team, and project. However, there are some common elements that most software engineers experience:

### Writting Maintainable Code

Who could have guessed? Writing code is the core of a software engineer's job.

As a software engineer, you’ll be expected to write clean, maintainable code that adheres to best practices and coding standards.

A big difference between the assignments you do in school and the code you write in a job is that your code will be read by other people and need to be maintained over time.

You don't just get throw away code when you finish a project. Instead the bad code you write today will come back to haunt you tomorrow.

Just because a solution works, doesn't mean it's the right solution for your team. Readability, maintainability, and performance are all important factors to consider when writing code in a professional setting.

### Maintaining and Monitoring Software

Once you’ve written code, your job isn’t done. You’ll need to maintain and monitor the software you build to ensure it continues to work as expected.

This includes:

- Fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities
- Updating dependencies and libraries
- Monitoring performance and reliability
- Responding to user feedback and requests for changes

Engineering teams often use tools like logging, monitoring, and alerting to keep track of how their software is performing in production.

Engineers are often on-call to respond to issues that arise outside of regular working hours, especially in production environments.

Engineers need to balance prioritizing new features with maintaining existing code. This often means making trade-offs between adding new functionality and ensuring the stability of the system.

### Collaborating with your Team

Software engineers work in teams. How these teams are structured and how they collaborate can vary widely, but the key is that you’ll rarely be working in isolation.

You might be part of a cross-functional team that includes designers, product managers, and other engineers, or you might work in a more specialized team focused on a specific area of the codebase.

Software development is a collaborative effort, communicate with your team by creating technical design documents, documentation, and giving and receiving feedback through code reviews.

In chapter 4.5, we'll further discuss team structures and how they affect your work.

### It's Not About Tech, It's About Solving Problems

Ultimately, whether it'ss a small startup, a large corporation, a government agency, or a non-profit, the goal of a software engineer is to solve problems, not just write code.

This means understanding user needs, business requirements, and technical constraints to build software that meets real-world demands.

What matters is not how much code you write, but how much value you deliver to the business and its users.

Software engineers are expensive, and if there was a better solution to a problem than hiring a software engineer, companies would use it.
