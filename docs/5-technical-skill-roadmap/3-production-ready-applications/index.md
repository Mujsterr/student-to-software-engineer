# 5.3. L3: Production-Ready Applications

At this point, you know how to write code that works—and maybe even works well. But real-world software isn’t just about writing features. It’s about building systems that are **reliable**, **maintainable**, and **scalable**.

This chapter is about everything that happens **after** the code “runs on your machine.”

Welcome to the world of **production-ready applications**.

## What Does “Production-Ready” Mean?

A production-ready application is one that can safely and confidently run in the real world—with real users, real data, and real consequences.

- If something breaks, you can find out why
- If traffic spikes, your system doesn’t fall over
- If a teammate makes a change, it doesn’t take the whole system down
