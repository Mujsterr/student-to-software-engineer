# 5.2. Level Self-Assessment

Everyone starts their journey at a different point. Some of you might be writing your first lines of code, while others already have real-world projects under your belt. This roadmap will help you identify what you already know and what you still need to learn to be industry-ready.

Use this as a guided checklist to evaluate where you are—and where you're heading.

## Level 1: Programming Fundamentals

You’re just getting started, or you’ve recently completed an intro course.

- [ ] 🧠 I understand core concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- [ ] 💻 I can write and run basic programs in at least one language (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript).
- [ ] 📚 I know basic data structures (arrays, lists, maps) and simple algorithms.
- [ ] 🐛 I can debug simple issues in my code using console logs or debugging tools.
- [ ] 🧱 I understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- [ ] 🤝 I understand how to use Git and GitHub for version control.

## Level 2: Beginner Applications

You can build a basic CRUD web app with a frontend, backend, and database.

- [ ] 🎨 I can build simple web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [ ] 🖥️ I have built a RESTful API that supports CRUD operations and understand the basics of HTTP.
- [ ] 🗄️ I can connect to and query a database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB).
- [ ] 🚀 I can deploy a basic web application to a platform like Heroku or Vercel.
- [ ] 🧪 I write unit tests for my code and understand the importance of testing.

## Level 3: Production-Ready Development

You’re starting to build real-world applications using modern tools and workflows.

- [ ] 🎨 I can build frontend apps using libraries like React, Vue, or Angular.
- [ ] 🧠 I understand state management and asynchronous operations.
- [ ] 🖥️ I’ve built an application with an MVC web framework like Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, or ASP.NET.
- [ ] 🗄️ I can design relational databases and model them with Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
- [ ] 🤝 I can work with a team using Git branching strategies (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).
- [ ] 🛠️ I can resolve merge conflicts and know when to use rebase vs. merge.
- [ ] 🧠 I participate in code reviews and can identify areas for improvement in others' code.
- [ ] 🐳 I’ve used Docker to containerize applications and understand the basics of container orchestration.
- [ ] ☁️ I’ve deployed applications to beginner-friendly cloud platforms (e.g., AWS EC2, S3, Render, or Railway).
- [ ] ⚙️ I’m familiar with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools like GitHub Actions.
- [ ] 👁️ I’ve explored observability tools and am aware of logging and monitoring as a concept.
- [ ] 🧪 I can write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and understand when to use each type.

## Level 4: Junior Developer Expectations

You’re ready to join a real team, contribute to production codebases, and grow under mentorship.

- [ ] 🧱 I can implement features across the stack of a modern MVC CRUD App.
- [ ] 🧼 I write tested, clean, maintainable code that follows team conventions and best practices.
- [ ] 🧭 I can break down tasks, and manage my own work within a sprint or project.
- [ ] 🧠 I can read and understand technical documentation and unfamiliar codebases with some assistance.
- [ ] 🐛 I can diagnose and debug issues using logs, stack traces, and observability tools.
- [ ] 🤝 I am able to participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback in areas of my expertise.
- [ ] 🛡️ I understand basic security and performance considerations for web applications.
- [ ] ⛑️ I’m comfortable asking for help and taking initiative when I’m stuck.
- [ ] 📊 I’m familiar with Agile practices like daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint planning.
- [ ] 🧠 I can learn new technologies and frameworks independently and apply them to projects.
