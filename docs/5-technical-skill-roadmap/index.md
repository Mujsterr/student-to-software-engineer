# 5. The Skills You Need to get Hired

One of the major upsides of breaking into the tech industry is how accessible it is to self-learn.

You don’t need a fancy degree, you can teach yourself using YouTube videos, online courses, tutorials, and documentation. But this freedom comes with a serious downside: **decision paralysis**.

When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Should you learn Python or JavaScript? Frontend or backend? React or Angular? What about databases? DevOps? AI? The sheer volume of buzzwords, tools, and conflicting advice can make it hard to know where to begin—or what actually matters to employers.

This problem is made worse by the rapid turnover of technologies in the field. Every year, new frameworks emerge, old ones fall out of favor, and online tutorials become outdated almost as fast as they’re published. Add in the flood of poorly written or oversimplified content online, and you’ve got a perfect storm for confusion.

The goal of this chapter is to cut through the noise. We're going to provide you with a clear, actionable roadmap of the skills you need to learn to get hired in tech and why those skills matter.

## The Structure of This Chapter

In this chapter I have broken down the skills you need to learn into four levels of technical proficiency, each building on the last.

These levels are of my design and they are not official industry standards, **with the execption of Level 4**, which is based on the expectations of junior developers in the industry.

Your goal as an aspiring software developer is to work your way as close as you can to Level 4 before you attempt to land a full-time job.

Internships are typically looking for students who have some set of skills between levels 2-4, while full-time positions expect you to be at Level 4 or higher.

You should aim to learn the skills in each level in order, as they build on each other. However, you can also learn some skills from higher levels while still working on the lower levels.

- **Level 1: Programming Fundamentals** - The core concepts and skills you need to write basic code.
- **Level 2: Beginner Applications** - How to build simple applications with a frontend, backend, and database.
- **Level 3: Production-Ready Applications** - The tools and practices needed to build real-world applications that are maintainable, scalable, and deployable.
- **Level 4: Expected Junior Developer Proficiency** - The skills and knowledge you need to be a productive member of a software development team.

## How To Use This Chapter

The goal of this chapter is not to give detailed tutorials on any skill or technology. Instead, it’s only a list and a justification of the skills you need to learn to get hired in tech.

It’s meant to be a high-level overview that helps you understand what’s important and why.

You will need to do your own research and find your own resources. But this chapter will give you a clear sense of direction and help you prioritize what to focus on.
