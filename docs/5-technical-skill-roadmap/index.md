# 5. The Skills You Need to get Hired

One of the major upsides of breaking into the tech industry is how accessible it is.

You don’t need a fancy degree to learn how to code—you can teach yourself using YouTube videos, online courses, tutorials, and documentation. But this freedom comes with a serious downside: **decision paralysis**.

When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Should you learn Python or JavaScript? Frontend or backend? React or Angular? What about databases? DevOps? AI? The sheer volume of buzzwords, tools, and conflicting advice can make it hard to know where to begin—or what actually matters to employers.

This problem is made worse by the rapid turnover of technologies in the field. Every year, new frameworks emerge, old ones fall out of favor, and online tutorials become outdated almost as fast as they’re published. Add in the flood of poorly written or oversimplified content online, and you’ve got a perfect storm for confusion.

The goal of this chapter is to cut through the noise. We're going to provide you with a clear, actionable roadmap of the skills you need to learn to get hired in tech and why those skills matter.
