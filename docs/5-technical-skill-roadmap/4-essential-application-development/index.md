# 5.4. L2: Beginner Applications

This is where things start to feel real.

Level 1 is about writing code that runs. Level 2 is about writing code that people can actually use—over the web, with a real interface, data that persists, and maybe even some users. If you’ve made it here, congrats: you're no longer just a student learning how to code. You're building software.

At this level, your goal is to build and ship a basic full-stack application—nothing fancy, just something that ties together a frontend, backend, and database. You’ll make design choices, deal with bugs, wrestle with deployment, and start to understand how all the moving pieces of modern software fit together.
