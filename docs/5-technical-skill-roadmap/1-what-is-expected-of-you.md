# 5.1. What Is Expected of Interns

Interns are expected to operate at the level of a junior developer **in training**.

Meaning you should be able to fill some, but not all, of the responsibilities of a junior developer.

No one expects you to be ready to take on a full-time developer role right away, but you should be able to contribute meaningfully to the team and learn quickly.

However, it's important to understand what is expected of a full-time developer, because ultimately the closer you are to filling that role, the more likely you are to seem like a capable hire.

# What Developers Need To Know?

A developer builds, tests, and maintains software applications.

To do that, you need to know the parts that make up a software application, how they work together, and how to use them effectively.

Applications are made by teams, meaning you need to know how to collaboratively work with others to build software.

Every developer needs to know how to read and write code, but also how to work with existing codebases, collaborate with other developers, and communicate effectively with team members.

<!--
## Experience with "Maintaining Existing Codebases"

School assignments are usually created from scratch and thrown away after the course is over.

In the real world, most of the code you will work on is existing code that needs to be maintained, improved, or fixed.

This requires a different kind of mindset than building something from scratch.

You need to be able to read and understand existing code, identify areas for improvement, and make changes without breaking anything.


## Experience Collaborating on Code

Most students have never worked on a codebase with multiple developers before their first internship, and this is a critical skill for any software developer.

You learn quickly that the most efficient solution, is not always the solution that best fits the team's needs.

Most students have never used version control before their first internship, and this is a critical skill for any software developer.

You should be familiar with the basics of Git, including how to clone a repository, create branches, commit changes, and push/pull code.








What is expected of a junior developer varies, but generally includes:
- Writing and debugging code under close guidance
- Contributing to small features or bug fixes, but NOT yet lead or own projects
- Participating in code reviews and team meetings, but NOT yet lead them
- Learning and adapting to the team's coding standards and practices
- Communicating effectively with team members and asking for help when needed
- Show initiative in learning new technologies and improving skills
- Follow established processes and workflows, but also be open to feedback and improvement
- Be proactive in seeking out tasks and responsibilities, but also know when to ask for help
- Understand the basics of version control and how to use it effectively -->
