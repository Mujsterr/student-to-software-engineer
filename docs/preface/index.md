# Preface

This is a free textbook written for university students who are trying to launch their careers in software development.

It’s based on the talks I’ve given to hundreds of students over the past few years, and shaped by my own experiences as a computer science student at Carleton University, where I completed several internships have was have now worked several years as a full-time software developer.

In recent years, it has unquestionably become harder for students to land jobs in tech, leaving many unsure whether they’ll be able to break into tech and get their start. This book is meant to serve as a practical guide—essentially, a “bible” for your early career—to help you navigate university, build experience, and make the most of your time as a student.

The content is drawn from a variety of blog posts, talks, and resources I’ve created, all updated and restructured into a more coherent and digestible format. It includes strategies for finding internships, gaining real experience without a job, understanding the tech industry, and positioning yourself to stand out as a new grad.

If you find any errors, outdated advice, or sections that could be improved, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
