# Preface

This free textbook is for university students looking to launch their careers in software development.

It’s shaped by my experiences as a computer science student navigating internships, full-time roles, and the tech industry—as well as the insights of thousands of peers, mentors, and mentees I’ve connected with over the years.

In recent years, it’s become undeniably harder for students to land jobs in tech. Many are left wondering whether they’ll ever get their foot in the door. This book is meant to serve as a practical guide—essentially, a bible for your early career—offering clear, actionable advice to help you make the most of your time in university, build real experience, and stand out when it matters most.

The content is drawn from blog posts, talks, and resources I’ve created over time, now updated and reorganized into something more cohesive and digestible. Inside, you’ll find strategies for finding internships, gaining experience without a job, understanding how the tech industry actually works, and positioning yourself to succeed as a new grad.

If you spot any errors, outdated advice, or sections that could be improved, I’d love to hear from you.
