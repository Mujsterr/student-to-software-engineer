# 7.6.2 Phone Screens

A phone screen is a short conversation (usually around 30 minutes) with a recruiter to assess your basic qualifications and determine if it’s worth having you interview with a real engineer.

At this stage, the recruiter may ask about:

- Your location and availability
- Work authorization status
- Salary or hourly rate expectations
- Basic technical background or resume highlights

In addition to these questions, the recruiter will judge your communication skills, enthusiasm, and cultural fit to the company. They want to see that you can articulate your experiences clearly and show genuine interest in the role.

There are usually no coding questions during the phone screen. If you pass, you’ll move on to a more technical round.

With the pressure to follow the academic calendar, many companies may not do phone screens at all, or may not need to if all the required information is already supplied through your university co-op profile.

## How to Prepare for Phone Screens

Phone screens may feel casual, but they’re still an interview. Treat them with the same level of preparation and professionalism as you would a technical round.

### Research the Company and Role

Make sure you know what the company does, its mission, and its values. Can you summarize their product, mission, and values?

Understand the role. What skills are they looking for? Make sure you can explain how your background and skill set are exactly what they need.

Look up recent news about the company. Are they launching new products, expanding into new markets, or facing any challenges? This shows you’re engaged and informed.

### Have Your Resume in Front of You

Assume the recruiter could ask you to explain any part of your resume. Be ready to discuss your experiences, projects, and skills in detail.

Consider creating a private "notes" document with key points about your experiences, skills, and answers to questions they might ask.

Recruiters often ask questions like “Tell me about your project on X” or “Walk me through your experience at Y.” Be ready to speak clearly about every item listed.

### Practice Common Questions

Practice answering common phone screen questions. Here are a few to get you started:

- "Tell me about yourself."
- "Why are you interested in this role?"
- "What do you know about our company?"
- "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
- "Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame the challenges."

Questins like these are so common that you need to make sure your answers to these questions are clear, concise, and tailored to the role you’re applying for.

Each time you answer a question, you need to leverage the opportunity to highlight your skills and experiences that are perfect for the role.

### Prepare Questions to Ask Them

Asking thoughtful questions helps show your interest in the position.

Likewise, asking no questions can make you seem uninterested or unprepared.

Do NOT ask questions that can be easily answered by looking at the company website or job description. Instead, focus on questions that show you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the role.
