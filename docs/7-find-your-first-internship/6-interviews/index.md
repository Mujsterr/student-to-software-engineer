# 7.6. Interviews

Compared to full-time roles, internship interview processes are often significantly shorter and more streamlined.

Because companies are under pressure to make hiring decisions quickly to align with university co-op cycles, they tend to compress the process into just one or two rounds. 

It's not uncommon for students to even receive offers after a single 30-minute conversation.

This speed doesn’t mean the interviews are easy, though. With limited time, interviewers aim to assess your potential quickly and efficiently. They’re looking for clear communication, fundamental technical skills, and a general sense of whether you’d be a good fit for the team.
