# 7.6. Interviews

Compared to full-time roles, internship interview processes are often significantly shorter and more streamlined.

Because companies are under pressure to make hiring decisions quickly to align with university co-op cycles, they tend to compress the process into just one or two rounds.

It's not uncommon for students to even receive offers after a single 30-minute conversation.

This speed doesn’t mean the interviews are easy, though. With limited time, interviewers aim to assess your potential quickly and efficiently. They’re looking for clear communication, fundamental technical skills, and a general sense of whether you’d be a good fit for the team.

## Universisal Interview Advice

For every company I interviewed with, I always followed prepare in the following ways.

### Research the Company and Role

Make sure you know what the company does, its mission, and its values. Can you summarize their product, mission, and values?

Understand the role. What skills are they looking for? Make sure you can explain how your background and skill set are exactly what they need.

Look up recent news about the company. Are they launching new products, expanding into new markets, or facing any challenges? This shows you’re engaged and informed.

### Have Your Resume in Front of You

Assume the recruiter could ask you to explain any part of your resume. Be ready to discuss your experiences, projects, and skills in detail.

Consider creating a private "notes" document with key points about your experiences, skills, and answers to questions they might ask.

Recruiters often ask questions like “Tell me about your project on X” or “Walk me through your experience at Y.” Be ready to speak clearly about every item listed.

### Practice Common Questions

Practice answering common phone screen questions. Here are a few to get you started:

- "Tell me about yourself."
- "Why are you interested in this role?"
- "What do you know about our company?"
- "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
- "Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame the challenges."

Questions like these are so common that you need to make sure your answers to these questions are clear, concise, and tailored to the role you’re applying for.

Each time you answer a question, you need to leverage the opportunity to highlight your skills and experiences that are perfect for the role.

### Never Use the Same Story Twice

When you're answering interview questions, each will usually prompt you to share a story from your past experiences.

Use each of these opportunities to share different stories that showcase different skills and experiences.

If you use the same story twice, you're denying yourself the chance to further showcase your skills and experiences.

### Prepare Questions to Ask Them

Asking thoughtful questions helps show your interest in the position.

Likewise, asking no questions can make you seem uninterested or unprepared.

Do NOT ask questions that can be easily answered by looking at the company website or job description. Instead, focus on questions that show you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the role.
