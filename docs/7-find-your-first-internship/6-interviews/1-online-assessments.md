# 7.6.1. Online Assessments (OAs)

When you think of online assessments, you probably think of the **automated online assessment**, typically a code challenge where you will be given a problem and asked to solve it within a set time limit. These assessments are often conducted through platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codility.

The code you write is then automatically evaluated against a set of test cases, and you receive immediate feedback on whether your solution passed or failed. You may even be expected to complete a series of problems within a set time frame.

These assessments often focus on **algorithmic** and data structure questions, similar to what you might find in competitive programming. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are popular for practicing these types of problems.

Since they do not require the supervision of an interviewer and are completely automated, the goal of using these kinds of assessments is typically to filter candidates and reduce the time and resources that engineering managers and developers would otherwise spend conducting interviews for large pools of applicants.

### Other Types of Online Assessments

Not all online assessments are automated coding challenges. Some companies may use different formats, such as:

- **Take-home project**: You’re given a coding task to complete on your own time, usually within a few days. This allows you to work at your own pace but is more time-consuming.
- **Code review assessment**: You’re asked to review a piece of code and provide feedback, which tests your understanding of best practices and ability to spot issues.
- **Bug fixing assessment**: You’re given a piece of code with intentional bugs and asked to identify and fix them, which tests your debugging skills.
- **Integration style assessment**: Not all OAs are algorithmic. Some companies may ask you to write code that integrates with a specific API or framework, simulating a real-world coding task.
