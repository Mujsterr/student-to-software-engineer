# 7.3. Cover Letters

As a university student with little to no experience, you may be wondering how to write a cover letter that stands out.

## Show Interest in the Company

A cover letter is your chance to show that you care about the company and the role. It’s an opportunity to explain why you want to work there and how you can contribute.

Do not suck up to hard, but a simple statement like "... and I'd be excited to help (organization) achieve (companies goal)." can go a long way.

## Don't Duplicate Your Resume

Your cover letter should not simply repeat what’s on your resume. Instead, it should highlight specific experiences or skills that make you a good fit for the role.

Use your cover letter to explain how your background interests align with the company’s mission and values.

Example: "I'm drawn to (company) because of its commitment to (value or mission). My experience in (relevant experience) has prepared me to contribute to (this goal)."

## Do I Event Need a Cover Letter?

Will every company read your cover letter? No.

Smaller companies and those that you know have a human review applicants have a higher chance of reading your cover letter.

I recommend only writing a fully personalized cover letter for companies you really care about. For other companies, just use a template and fill in the blanks.
