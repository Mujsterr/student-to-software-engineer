# 7. Find Your First Internship

To succeed in finding your first software job, you need to present yourself as someone who can actually build software.

This might sound obvious, but most students fail to do this because they don't understand what skills are actually expected of a junior software engineer.

In chapter 4, we discussed what responsibilities are expected of a junior software engineer and in chapter 5, we discussed the order in which you should learn the technical skills needed to fulfill those responsibilities.

In this chapter, we will cover how to present those skills and everything else regarding the job search process you need to know to find your first internship or job.
