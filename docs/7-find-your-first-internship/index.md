# 7. Find Your First Internship

To succeed in finding your first software job, you need to present yourself as someone who can actually build software.

This might sound obvious, but most students fail to do this because they don't understand what skills are actually expected of a junior software engineer.

- In chapter 4, we discussed what responsibilities are expected of a junior software engineer and
- In chapter 5, we discussed the order in which you should learn the technical skills needed to fulfill those responsibilities.
- In chapter 6, we discussed how to build projects that demonstrate those skills and responsibilities.

Now finally in this chapter, we will cover how to present those skills and how to actually land your first job.
