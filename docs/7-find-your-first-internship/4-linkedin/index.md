# 7.4. LinkedIn

Connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn is the modern equivalent of dropping off your resume in person.

## How To Reach Out To Recruiters

With companies you want to work for, search their employees for **recruiters** or **early-talent specialists**. These are the people who are responsible for finding and hiring interns and entry-level candidates.

When you find a recruiter who works at a company you're interested in, send them a connection request with a personalized message. Here’s a template you can use:

This is the modern equivalent of dropping off your resume in person. It's also way shorter than a cover letter, so it’s less intimidating for both you and the recruiter.

## Your Profile

Your LinkedIn profile should be more than a copy paste of your resume.

It should give the recruiter more context about who you are, what you’re interested in, and what you can bring to the table.

## How Activity Affects Your Profile

LinkedIn favors active users. A few things that can help you show up more in searches:

- React to posts from people at companies you want to work for
- Share cool projects you’re working on
- Follow companies you're interested in

This doesn’t mean you need to become a LinkedIn influencer. Just being semi-active signals to the algorithm (and recruiters) that you're engaged and open to opportunities.
