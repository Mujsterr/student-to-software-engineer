# 7.2. Resumes

There are thousands of free resources on how to write your tech resume online, so I won't go into too much detail here. Instead I want to focus on the philosophy of what students often get wrong when writing their resumes.

## The Goal of Your Resume

You should write your resume with the goal of:

**Presenting yourself as someone ready to work as a full-time software engineer** (even if you are just a student with no formal work experience).

Let's recall the list of technical skills expected of a junior software engineer from chapter 5.

For each of these skills, you should ask yourself: Have I demonstrated this skill in my resume?

If the answer is no, then you need to ask yourself: How can I get this skill on my resume?

Need to add a skill or skills? Build a project that uses that skill, contribute to an open source project that uses that skill, or volunteer to build something for a non-profit that uses that skill.

## I Have No Experience, What Do I Put on My Resume?

Everything from chapter 6 and any volunteer work from chapter 3:

- Personal projects
- Open source contributions
- Volunteer work
- Hackathons
- University projects
- Clubs and societies
- Anything that demonstrates your ability to build software

**It is your fault** if you have nothing to put on your resume by the time you are looking for internships.

## I Have No Experience, But I Need a Job Now, What Do I Do?

If you are reading this book and you're in a rush, but have no experience, then you should:

### Lie on Your Resume

What? Yes, you should lie on your resume.

Ultimately, if you haven't made the effort to build real skills and don't have real experience to pull from in your interviews, then you're probably gonna blow it anyways. Your going to suck in interviews and not get hired, but at least you will have the opportunity to practice your interviewing skills.

You might be thinking, "But isn't lying on your resume unethical?"

Yes, it is unethical, what even really is a lie anyways?

If I follow a youtube tutorial to build a simple web application, and then I put that on my resume, is that a lie?

I didn't build it from scratch, but I did build it. I learned something in the process, and I can talk about it in an interview.

Here's the thing, your a student, there are so many inexperienced students out there that when an inexperienced student looks good on paper, but turns out to be a bad candidate in an interview, the interviewer will just assume they were not ready for the job yet and move on to the next candidate.

Students learn so much so quickly that a company is willing

- Lie about volunteer work. Who is going to check? Just make sure you can talk about it in an interview.

Your resume is just a marketing document to get you interviews, so you should do whatever it takes to get interviews.

## My Resume Is Not Getting Me Interviews, What Do I Do?

If your resume is not getting you interviews, its probably because you either:

1. Are not applying to enough jobs
2. Are not presenting yourself as someone who can actually build software
3. Have not formatted your resume correctly
