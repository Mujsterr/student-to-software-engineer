# 7.2. Resumes

There are thousands of free resources on how to write your tech resume online, so I won't go into too much detail here. Instead I want to focus on the philosophy of what students often get wrong when writing their resumes.

## The Goal of Your Resume

You should write your resume with the goal of:

**Presenting yourself as someone ready to work as a full-time software engineer** (even if you are just a student with no formal work experience).

Let's recall the list of technical skills expected of a junior software engineer from chapter 5.

For each of these skills, you should ask yourself: Have I demonstrated this skill in my resume?

If the answer is no, then you need to ask yourself: How can I get this skill on my resume?

Need to add a skill or skills? Build a project that uses that skill, contribute to an open source project that uses that skill, or volunteer to build something for a non-profit that uses that skill.

## I Have No Experience, What Do I Put on My Resume?

Everything from chapter 6 and any volunteer work from chapter 3:

- Personal projects
- Open source contributions
- Volunteer work
- Hackathons
- University projects
- Clubs and societies
- Anything that demonstrates your ability to build software

**It is your fault** if you have nothing to put on your resume by the time you are looking for internships.

## My Resume Is Not Getting Me Interviews, What Do I Do?

If your resume is not getting you interviews, its probably because you either:

1. Are not applying to enough jobs
2. Are not presenting yourself as someone who can actually build software
3. Have not formatted your resume correctly
