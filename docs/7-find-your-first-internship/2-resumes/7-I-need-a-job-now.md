# 7.2.7. Zero Experience? In a Bind? Just Lie.

If you are reading this, and have **NOT** made the effort to build real skills through volunteering or building projects (chapter 6), you only really have one option left:

You need to **lie on your resume**.

You might be thinking, "But isn't lying on your resume unethical?"

Yes, it is unethical, but what even really is a lie anyways?

## What Even Is A Lie?

If I follow a Youtube tutorial to build a simple application, and then I put that on my resume, is that a lie?

I didn't build it from scratch, but I did build it. I learned something in the process, and I can talk about it in an interview.

You don't have to say that you used a Youtube tutorial to build it, you can just say you built it.

If you really want to push it, just write your resume, without doing the tutorial and then follow the tutorial sometime before the interview.

## Lying Doesn't Mean You Won't Blow It

Ultimately, if you haven't made the effort to build real skills and don't have real experience to pull from in your interviews, then you're gonna be bad in interviews and ultimately not get hired. But at least you will have the opportunity to practice your interviewing skills.
