# 7.2.3. ATS and Common Templates

When it comes to formatting your resume, you should pay special attention to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and the common templates that many candidates use.

### Consider ATS

When creating your resume, it's important to consider Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These systems are used by many companies to filter resumes before they reach human eyes. Here are some tips to ensure your resume is ATS-friendly:

- **Use Standard Headings**: Stick to common headings like "Experience", "Education", and "Skills". Avoid creative headings that might confuse the ATS.
- **Avoid Graphics and Images**: ATS may not read graphics or images correctly, so it's best to stick to text.
- **Use Keywords**: Tailor your resume with keywords from the job description. ATS often scans for specific terms related to the job.
- **Simple Formatting**: Use a clean, simple format without complex tables or columns (2 column resumes). This helps ensure that the ATS can read your resume correctly.

### Common Templates & Template Fatigue

The templates you'll probably hear about the most are Jake's Resume Template and Awesome CV. If you are making your first resume, these templates can be a great starting point. Both these templates are designed to be ATS-friendly and can be easily modified to follow the expected format for tech resumes.

While templates can be helpful, it's important to be aware of "template fatigue."

Template fatigue refers to the phenomenon where many candidates use the same or similar templates, leading to a lack of uniqueness in resumes. This can make it difficult for your resume to stand out in a sea of applicants, especially when many people are using the same popular templates.

The reality is using one of the common templates above is the "status quo" way to present your resume. Many candidates will use these templates, and while they are ATS-friendly, they may not be unique enough to catch the eye of hiring managers.

### AST Only Matters for Non-Human Readers

When you are black box applying at a big company you know is using ATS, then yesâ€”definitely use a template you know is ATS-friendly.

But if you are in a situation where you know your resume will be read by a human, then you should do everything in your power to stand out.

When you are:

- At a Career Fair or Networking Event
- Applying to a small company or startup (with limited dedicated Talent Acquisition resources)
- Referred by a friend or colleague
- Cold emailing a hiring manager or recruiter
- Sending your resume through LinkedI

You can should use a more creative format that showcases your personality and skills. This could include unique layouts (two column resumes), colors, something that reflects your personal brand, or connects with the company culture.

I personally **maintain two copies of my resume: one optimized for ATS and another designed for human readers.** The ATS version should follow the guidelines mentioned above, while the human version can be more visually appealing and creative.

### Is Color Ok In On My Resume?

It depends on the culture of the company you are applying to.

In general, it's best to keep your resume professional and avoid excessive use of color.

If you are applying to a more traditional or conservative company, stick to a simple black and white format.

However, if you are applying to a company with a more creative or relaxed culture, using color can help your resume stand out.
