# 7.2.2.1. Header

The header of your resume is the first thing employers see, so it should be clear and professional.

Include your name, contact information (email, phone), and links to relevant profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal website).

I do not personally include a physical address in my header, as it is not relevant to most employers and can take up valuable space. If an office is located in a specific city, the employer will likely assume you are located in that city or are willing to relocate.

### Do I Need A GitHub?

Yes. Your GitHub is how you showcase that you actually have made something when you have no experience.

Does it need to be full of code? No. If your GitHub is empty, just throw up a private repo with a few commits to atleast emulate that you have done something.

Having the Github Profile is also a way of signally you know how to use Git, which is a mandatory requirement for software engineering roles.

### Do I Need a Personal Website?

A personal website is not strictly necessary, but it's definitely a "nice to have" and can set you apart from other candidates. If you are short on time, it's not the top priority.

Your GitHub already serves as a portfolio, but a personal website allows you to showcase your work in a more polished and controlled manner.

For one of my first jobs, I was told the reason I landed it because of my personal website. I was told I was the only candidate who had shown evidence they actually could build a website.
