# 7.2.2.2. Education

List your degree, major, university, and any specializations. Include relevant coursework if applicable.

### Keep This Section Short

Your education should ideally be no more than 2-3 lines.

Every other student applying for the same job will have the an identical education section, so itâ€™s not a differentiator.

Long education sections make it look like you have nothing better to show and push down more relevant and unique sections of your resume.

### Why Should I Put My Education First?

Ultimately, whether you put your education first or not is up to you, but I personally believe it's good to signal that you are a student by putting your education section first.

I find one reason people recommend putting it lower is if their education section is long, it pushes down the more relevant sections of your resume, which is a problem.

However, If your education section is short (as I've recommended above), it doesn't create this problem.

### Include Co-op Accreditatiob

Some employers, especially in Canada, look for co-op accreditation on resumes because they receive funding from the government to hire students from acredited co-op programs.

If you are registered in a university co-op program, it is worth explicitly calling out in a way that takes up minimal space.

### Should You Include GPA?

If you believe your GPA is strong, include it. It takes up limited space and can be a positive signal to employers.

If you don't feel it's strong, leave it off unless specifically requested.

### Should I Include Expected Graduation Date?

Some employers are specifcally only looking to hire students they believe they can eventually convert to full-time employees.

This means that if you are a student nearly the end of your degree, it's in your best interest to include your expected graduation date.

If you are a first or second year student, including start and end dates can potentially hurt your chances of getting an interview with companies that are looking for students who can convert to full-time employees in the near future.
