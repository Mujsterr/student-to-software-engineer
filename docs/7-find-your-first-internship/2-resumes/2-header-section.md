# 7.2.2. Top Resume Sections

As a student, with zero experience, your resume should ideally start with the following sections

## 1. Header

The header of your resume is the first thing employers see, so it should be clear and professional.

Include your name, contact information (email, phone), and links to relevant profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal website).

I do not personally include a physical address in my header, as it is not relevant to most employers and can take up valuable space. If an office is located in a specific city, the employer will likely assume you are located in that city or are willing to relocate.

### Do I Need A GitHub?

Yes. Your GitHub is how you showcase that you actually have made something when you have no experience.

Does it need to be full of code? No. If your GitHub is empty, just throw up a private repo with a few commits to atleast emulate that you have done something.

Having the Github Profile is also a way of signally you know how to use Git, which is a mandatory requirement for software engineering roles.

### Do I Need a Personal Website?

A personal website is not strictly necessary, but it's definitely a "nice to have" and can set you apart from other candidates. If you are short on time, it's not the top priority.

Your GitHub already serves as a portfolio, but a personal website allows you to showcase your work in a more polished and controlled manner.

For one of my first jobs, I was told the reason I landed it because of my personal website. I was told I was the only candidate who had shown evidence they actually could build a website.

## 2. Education

List your degree, major, university, and any specializations. Include relevant coursework if applicable.

### Keep This Section Short

Your education should ideally be no more than 2-3 lines.

Every other student applying for the same job will have the an identical education section, so itâ€™s not a differentiator.

Long education sections make it look like you have nothing better to show and push down more relevant and unique sections of your resume.

### Why Should I Put My Education First?

Ultimately, whether you put your education first or not is up to you, but I personally believe it's good to signal that you are a student by putting your education section first.

I find one reason people recommend putting it lower is if their education section is long, it pushes down the more relevant sections of your resume, which is a problem.

However, If your education section is short (as I've recommended above), it doesn't create this problem.

### Include Co-op Accreditation

Some employers, especially in Canada, look for co-op accreditation on resumes because they receive funding from the government to hire students from accredited co-op programs.

If you are registered in a university co-op program, it is worth explicitly calling out in a way that takes up minimal space.

### Should You Include GPA?

If you believe your GPA is strong, include it. It takes up limited space and can be a positive signal to employers.

If you don't feel it's strong, leave it off unless specifically requested.

### Should I Include Expected Graduation Date?

Some employers are specifically only looking to hire students they believe they can eventually convert to full-time employees.

This means that if you are a student nearly the end of your degree, it's in your best interest to include your expected graduation date.

If you are a first or second year student, including start and end dates can potentially hurt your chances of getting an interview with companies that are looking for students who can convert to full-time employees in the near future.

## 3. Skills

List programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies you are proficient in.

Include as many relevant skills as you can to maximize for ATS.

If the student job posting doesn't mention a specific skill, go look at full-time job postings for the same company and see what skills they are looking for in full-time employees.

### Why Should This Section Be At the Top?

This section is often the first thing recruiters look at. Non-technical recruiters may not understand the details of your projects, but will quickly scan for relevant skills.

There is a lot of **resume eye tracking research** that shows that recruiters often look at the **top third of a resume first**, so putting your skills here ensures they see them right away.

### What Skills Should You Not Include?

For software engineering roles, no one cares about your

- Microsoft Office, Visual Studio or any "Computer Program"-type skills
- Soft skills listed in the skills section (e.g. "teamwork", "communication")
- Jira, or other project management tool skills
- or any other skills that are not directly related to software engineering.

A good rule of thumb is to use the skills found on the job description as a guide for what to include.

### How Should You Categorize Skills?

A mistake I see many students make is burning valuable resume space by categorizing skills overly distinct categories like "Languages", "Libraries", "Frameworks", "Tools", "Databases", "Cloud", "Operating Systems", etc.

Instead I recommend you categorize your skills into broad categories to maximize white space.

So long as the skills you have semantically fit into the category, you can group them together.

For example instead of having a "frameworks" section with three skills and a "cloud" section with two skills, you can group them together under a broad category like "Technologies".

### Do Not Rank Your Skills By Proficiency

Do not rank your skills by proficiency, as this is subjective and can be misleading.

As a student, you likely have limited experience with each skill, so it's better to simply list them without trying to rank them.

A student with 5/5 proficiency in Python is likely not as proficient as a full-time software engineer with 5 years of experience with Python. So these proficiency rankings are meaningless.
