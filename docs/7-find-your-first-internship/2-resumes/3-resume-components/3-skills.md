# 7.2.3.3. Skills

List programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies you are proficient in.

Include as many relevant skills as you can to maximize for ATS.

If the student job posting doesn't mention a specific skill, go look at full-time job postings for the same company and see what skills they are looking for in full-time employees.

### Why Should This Section Be Near The Top?

This section is often the first thing recruiters look at. Non-technical recruiters may not understand the details of your projects, but will quickly scan for relevant skills.

There is a lot of **resume eye tracking research** that shows that recruiters often look at the **top third of a resume first**, so putting your skills here ensures they see them right away.

### What Skills Should You Not Include?

For software engineering roles, no one cares about your

- Microsoft Office, Visual Studio or any "Computer Program"-type skills
- Soft skills listed in the skills section (e.g. "teamwork", "communication")
- Jira, or other project management tool skills
- or any other skills that are not directly related to software engineering.

A good rule of thumb is to use the skills found on the job description as a guide for what to include.

### How Should You Categorize Skills?

A mistake I see many students make is burning valuable resume space by categorizing skills overly distinct categories like "Languages", "Libraries", "Frameworks", "Tools", "Databases", "Cloud", "Operating Systems", etc.

Instead I recommend you categorize your skills into broad categories to maximize white space.

So long as the skills you have semantically fit into the category, you can group them together.

For example instead of having a "frameworks" section with three skills and a "cloud" section with two skills, you can group them together under a broad category like "Technologies".

### Do Not Rank Your Skills By Proficiency

Do not rank your skills by proficiency, as this is subjective and can be misleading.

As a student, you likely have limited experience with each skill, so it's better to simply list them without trying to rank them.

A student with 5/5 proficiency in Python is likely not as proficient as a full-time software engineer with 5 years of experience with Python. So these proficiency rankings are meaningless.
