# 7.2.3.5. Miscellaneous

Here are other components that some people include in their resumes.

## Professional Summary

As a student you don't need this.

Ask yourself, what value would a professional summary add to your resume? If you have no work experience, it will not add any value.

## Objective

You do not need an objective on your resume.

Your objective is to get a job, and that is already clear from the fact that you are applying for a job.

## Availability

You do not need to include your availability on your resume.

If you are applying for an internship will take place in a defined term (e.g. summer internship), then it's implied you are available for that term.

## Certifications

If you have relevant certifications, they are sometimes worth including.

For example, I'd include an AWS certification, but not a Java Language certification. I'd much rather you show me a project you build with Java than a certification that you know Java.

I wouldn't spend too much space on certifications.
