# 7.1. Job Searching

When you're looking for your first internship, the timing and strategy of your job search can make a big difference.

## When to Search

Starting your job search too late can mean missing out on the best opportunities.

A good rule of thumb is to start searching **one semester before** your desired internship term. For example:

- **Fall internships**: Start looking in **Spring** (around **May**)
- **Winter internships**: Start looking in **Fall** (around **September**)
- **Summer internships**: Start looking in **Fall** (as early as August, especially for big tech, but around **January** for local companies)

For **summer internships**, large tech companies often open applications as early as **August of the previous year**. Smaller companies and startups tend to post roles closer to the start date, often around **January** or later, especially if they’re local and not part of a major tech hub.

Keep in mind that North American universities operate on different academic calendars—some use **semesters (three terms)** while others use **quarters (four terms)**—so adjust your timeline accordingly.

## Where to Search

There are lots of places to look for internships.

### Surface Level Job Boards

LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc all have job boards where companies post their open positions.

My advice with these is to make sure you are searching every "permutation" of the job title you are looking for.

For example, if you are looking for a "Software Engineer Intern" position, make sure you also search for "Software Developer Intern", "Software Intern", "Software Developer Co-op", "Developer Intern", "Developer Co-op", etc.

### LinkedIn as a Job Search Tool

One of the signal best ways I've bypassed black box applicant tracking systems is by reaching out to recruiters directly on LinkedIn.

The signal best way to do this is by finding posts made by recruiters when they are looking for candidates. These posts often include a link to apply, but this is a great excuse to try and connect with them and ask them a question about the role.

LinkedIn will be discussed more in depth in the [LinkedIn chapter](../4-linkedin/index.md).

### Online Communities

Online communities like Reddit, Discord, and Slack can be great places to find internship opportunities. Many tech-focused communities have dedicated job boards or channels where companies post openings.

The cscareers Discord for example has a bot that posts new job listings from various sources, including company websites and job boards as they are posted.

### University Career Services

Most universities have a career services office that can help you find internships. They often have job boards, resume workshops, and interview prep resources specifically for students.

This may or may not be coupled to your university has a co-op program.

### University Related Opportunities

Does your university have opportunities like research internships? Although these might not necessarily be software engineering roles, they can still provide valuable experience and networking opportunities.
