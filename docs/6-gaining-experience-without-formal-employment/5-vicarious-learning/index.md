# 6.5. Vicarious Learning

Just because you can't put it on your resume doesn't mean it isn't experience.

There are so many ways to help learn about software development that don't involve writing code or building projects yourself.

Vicarious learning, also known as observational learning, is a process where individuals learn new behaviors, skills, or attitudes by observing others.

Some great ways to engage in vicarious learning include:

- **Reading Technical Blogs** – Follow industry leaders and experts who share their insights, experiences, and lessons learned.
- **Watching Conference Talks** – Many tech conferences post their talks online. These can provide deep dives into specific technologies, methodologies, or case studies.
- **Listening to Podcasts** – There are many tech podcasts that discuss industry trends, interview experts, and share stories from the field.

# Learn To Present Yourself Technically

One area I've found many students struggle is in presenting themselves in a technical way.

Whether it's in the way they write their resume bullets, or how they communite in interviews, I find it's hard for students to know "what the right words are" and how they fit together.

The best way to overcome this is by listening to other developers talk about their work.

When you hear someone else explain a project, pay attention to the words they use, how they structure their explanations, and the technical details they include.

This will help you build a mental library of phrases and concepts that you can draw from when it's your turn to explain your own work.
