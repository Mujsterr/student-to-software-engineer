# 6.5. Vicarious Learning

As mentioned in section 1.4, what matters at the end of the day is the skills and context you're slowly building up, not what is or isn't on your resume.

One area I find many students struggle with is gainning experience in how to properly articulate yourself in a technical way.

I believe that one of the best ways to do gain experience in this is through **vicarious learning**.

Vicarious learning is the process of learning through the experiences of others. In the context of software development, this means absorbing knowledge from various sources—like books, articles, videos, and podcasts—without direct hands-on experience.

Listening to conference presentations or reading technical blogs will help you inanvertenly pick up the language and concepts used in the industry.

This is going to be especially helpful when you start interviewing, as you'll be able to speak more fluently about more complex technical topics, even if you haven't had industry experience working on those problems directly.
