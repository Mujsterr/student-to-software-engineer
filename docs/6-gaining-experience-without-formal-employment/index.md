# 6. Gain Experience Without a Job

In today’s crowded tech job market, all internships have applicants who already have hands-on experience.

Meaning, if your resume doesn’t showcase real-world development experience, it’s unlikely you’ll be considered.

So, how can you get real experience when every job demands it, but you don’t have any yet?

The answer is simple—whether people want to admit it or not, you likely need to do something unpaid.

Unpaid experience can take many forms:

- Personal projects – Build something that interests you, solve a real problem, or create a portfolio piece.
- Open-source contributions – Collaborate with others, learn best practices, and get your name attached to real-world projects.
- Volunteer work for a university club – Offer to build or improve their website, automate tasks, or contribute in a technical capacity.
- Unpaid freelancing or internships with startups – Many early-stage startups welcome eager contributors, even if they can’t afford salaries yet.
  Now, I’m not saying you should let a company exploit your time and skills. But, the reality is that everyone who has a job today got their start by working on something without being paid.

The key is to do real work to showcase skills relevant to building production-quality software or the daily responsibilities of a full-time software engineer.
