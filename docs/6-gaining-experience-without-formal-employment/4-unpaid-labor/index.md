# 6.4. Unpaid Labor

**Full disclaimer:** I strongly recommend avoiding prolonged unpaid work, and you should never let yourself be exploited.

There’s a fine line between gaining valuable experience and being taken advantage of, and unfortunately, some companies will try to get free labor from students under the guise of “unpaid internships.”

That said, in some cases, short-term unpaid work can be a strategic move—especially if it offers high-impact experience that directly improves your hireability.

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

- Companies asking for full-time, unpaid work with no path to compensation.
- “Internships” that involve mostly administrative or non-technical tasks.
- No clear mentorship or learning opportunity.

A good rule of thumb: If the unpaid work isn’t clearly helping you grow as a developer or leading to better career opportunities, skip it. The other options—personal projects, open source, university clubs, and research—are just as valuable.
