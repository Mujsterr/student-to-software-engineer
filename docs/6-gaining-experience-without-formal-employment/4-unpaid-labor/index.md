# 6.4. Unpaid Labor

**Full disclaimer: I don’t recommend doing unpaid work unless you have no other options.**

There’s a fine line between gaining valuable experience and being taken advantage of. Unfortunately, some companies will try to cross that line—offering unpaid “internships” that are little more than free labor in disguise.

That said, **short-term unpaid work can sometimes be a strategic move**, especially if:

- It gives you a chance to build real software in a production environment
- You’re working directly with experienced developers and receiving mentorship
- The experience significantly strengthens your resume or portfolio

But be cautious.

### Red Flags to Watch For:

- Full-time, unpaid work with no path to compensation or employment
- Internships focused on administrative tasks, not technical skill-building
- Little to no guidance, mentorship, or structured feedback
- Work that benefits the company far more than it helps you grow

A good rule of thumb:
**If the unpaid work isn’t clearly making you a better developer—or isn’t leading to stronger job opportunities—don’t do it.**

I would recommend never working unpaid for more than a school term **(3-4 months)**.

You have other options that are just as valuable and far less exploitative:
personal projects, open-source contributions, university clubs, hackathons, and research work.

Your time has value. Make sure you're spending it on something that moves you forward.
