# 6.2. Open Source Contributions

Can’t think of an idea for a project? Then consider contributing to someone else’s.

Although getting involved with open source may feel intimidating, it’s a great way to gain real experience and will look more favorably on your resume than something simple you built by following a YouTube tutorial.

If you’re not sure where to get started, look for issues on GitHub with the “Good First Issue” tag or check out goodfirstissues.dev for a list of open “good first issues” you can look at.
