# 6.1. Personal Projects

Personal projects are a quintessential aspect of being a Computer Science student and should make up a good chunk of your resume when you have no experience. (I would recommend including at least 1 or 2).

Including a project on your resume is the easiest way to demonstrate proficiency with in-demand skills.

## Why Personal Projects Matter

There are several reasons personal projects are so valuable:

- They give you something concrete to show. A GitHub repo, a deployed web app, a video demo—all of these show you’ve put your skills into action.

- They demonstrate initiative. Starting something on your own tells employers you're curious, motivated, and capable of managing a project without a manager telling you what to do.

- They help you learn faster. You'll build a greater understanding of how different technologies work together, and you'll learn to troubleshoot real-world problems.

- They give you something to talk about in interviews. You can walk interviewers through your process, your challenges, and the decisions you made—things that reveal how you think as a developer.

## What Counts as a “Project”?

A personal project doesn’t need to be groundbreaking, original, or even complete. If you built it and learned from it, it counts.

The point isn’t how advanced it is or whether it is complete—it’s **whether it gave you something to learn or show**. Even a small, well-executed project is worth far more than none at all.

Here are some examples, ranging from simple to more complex:

- A Python script that renames files in bulk
- A portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript
- A simple to-do list web app using Flask or React
- A Wordle or Tic-Tac-Toe clone built to practice frontend development
- A Discord bot that replies with quotes or reminders
- A stock tracker that sends alerts via email or SMS
- A personal blog with a CMS backend (e.g., built with Django or Next.js)
- A web dashboard that visualizes your Spotify listening history
- A Chrome extension that modifies or enhances a site you use often
- A real-time chat app using WebSockets
- A scheduling app for a club or student group with login and database storage
- A machine learning model that predicts housing prices or classifies images
- A browser-based multiplayer game built with a custom backend
- A full-stack app deployed to the cloud with CI/CD and user authentication
