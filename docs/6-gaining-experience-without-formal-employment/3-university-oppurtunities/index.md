# 6.3. University Opportunities

If you’re a university student, there are a number of ways you can gain real-world development experience through organizations at your school.

## Joining a Club

If you’re in some kind of tech program, it’s more than likely you will have an organization representing your student body or other adjacent tech clubs at your university that build work on development projects.

Here at Carleton University, the computer science student body is represented by the Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) which has a collection of open-source projects that are open for contribution.

Beyond that, several student-led organizations actively work on projects including but not limited to:

- CuHacking – Organizes the university’s annual hackathon, bringing students together to collaborate on innovative projects.
- CuBlueprint – A nonprofit student organization that develops pro bono software solutions for charities.
- CuInSpace – Focuses on building and refining tools for rocket launches and space exploration.
- Synchronize – Organizes recurring working sessions for artists, engineers, researchers, and makers.

Your university likely has at least one organization you can contribute to, whether through their existing initiatives or other projects they may need help with.

In the unlikely event there are really no existing organizations—start your own.

Not only will this demonstrate social and leadership skills on your resume, but it will also help you build connections and further grow your program’s community.

## Opportunities with Research Labs

Although research labs typically look for grad students, there are often opportunities for interested undergrads to get involved.

Send an email to whomever is leading the lab or try to find a precedent of undergrad students getting involved via the lab’s website.

Although research positions are usually paid, it’s definitely worth inquiring with the research labs or teaching staff whether there is possibly an opportunity to volunteer with them if they need some extra help.

If you can, it’s obviously best to aim for a paid position. At Carleton, we have a few paid opportunities for undergrads to get involved with research such as DSRI and I-CUREUS. Carleton also has the Students as Partners Program (SAPP) where students can get paid to work with teaching staff on projects that improve a course.

## Framing Volunteer Work As Experience

In contributing to projects—whether through clubs, open-source initiatives, or university-led research—you should aim to present this work on your resume just as you would a traditional job or internship.

Many students make the mistake of relegating their volunteer experience to a minor section, but if the work you did aligns with real-world software development, it deserves just as much emphasis as a paid job.
