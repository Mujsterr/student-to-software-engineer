# 6.3. University Opportunities

If you're a university student, there are a number of ways to gain real-world software development experience by getting involved with organizations and initiatives on campus.

## Joining a Club

Most tech-focused programs will have student-run clubs, societies, or project groups that work on development initiatives. These can be great places to apply your skills, collaborate with others, and build real experience outside of class.

Look for:

- A student society or association for your department or program
- Hackathon clubs that host or participate in events
- Engineering or software teams that build products or tools
- Nonprofit or community organizations that do pro bono tech work
- Recurring project work sessions or coding meetups

If your university doesn’t have many existing opportunities, you can always start your own initiative. Running a club or launching a collaborative project doesn’t just give you something to build—it also demonstrates leadership, initiative, and the ability to get others involved. All of which look great on a resume.

## Opportunities with Research Labs

While most research labs prioritize graduate students, many still welcome undergraduates—especially those with technical skills or strong initiative.

Even if no positions are posted, it's worth reaching out directly to the professor or lab lead. Express interest, share your background, and ask if there’s any way you can contribute—either as a volunteer or in a paid role.

Many schools also offer undergraduate research programs that provide funding or structured pathways for students to assist in faculty research or course development. Ask around or check your university's website for programs like:

- Undergraduate research internships
- Research assistant grants
- Student-as-partner programs
- Faculty-led special projects

Paid roles are obviously ideal, but even volunteering for a short period can give you hands-on experience, mentorship, and a valuable line on your resume.

## Framing Volunteer Work as Experience

Whether you’re contributing through a student club, a research lab, or an open-source initiative, you should treat this experience just like any job or internship.

Don’t bury it in a separate “volunteer” section. If the work involved real development skills—building features, fixing bugs, collaborating on a codebase—it belongs in your main experience section. Emphasize what you built, how you worked with others, and what tools or technologies you used.

Volunteer work can be just as impactful as paid experience if you frame it well.
