# 1. Introduction

Landing your first software job has never been harder.

A computer science degree is no longer a guaranteed ticket to employment and trying to learn everything on your own—through an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, blog posts, and conflicting advice—can feel overwhelming and directionless.

This book is here to help you cut through the noise.

Whether you're just beginning your university journey or already deep in the job hunt, this guide is designed to help you chart a clear, strategic path from student to software engineer.

## What This Book Covers

The chapters are structured to build on each other. Each one answers a different set of questions that students commonly face on their career journey:

### **Chapter 2: Why It’s So Hard To Get Hired**

This chapter explains why the job market is saturated with developers, and most aren't getting hired. This chapter explains the big-picture reasons why: skyrocketing university enrollment, AI, industry shifts, and a mismatch between what schools teach and what employers need.

### **Chapter 3: How To Make The Most Of University**

This chapter covers how university can (and can’t) prepare you for your career, and how to make the most of your time there—academically, socially, and strategically.

### **Chapter 4: Understanding the Workplace**

To succeed not only in finding a job, but also a job you actually enjoy, you need to understand what roles exist, how teams are structured, and most importantly what is actually expected of junior developers.

### **Chapter 5: The Skills You Need To Get Hired**

This chapter is structured as a massive checklist of the skills you need to get hired, their justifications, and how to learn them.

### **Chapter 6: Gain Experience Without a Job**

This chapter answers the question: "How do I get experience if I can’t get a job?" It covers how to build a portfolio, contribute to open source, and create personal projects that demonstrate your skills.

### **Chapter 7: Find Your First Internship**

This chapter covers how to apply for internships, what to include in your resume, how to prepare for interviews, and how to stand out from the competition. It also includes tips for networking and leveraging connections.

### **Chapter 8: Maximizing Internships**

This chapter explains how to make the most of your internship experience, from onboarding effectively to building relationships with your team.

### **Chapter 9: Full-Time Job Search**

This chapter covers how to transition from an internship to a full-time job, including how full-time roles differ from internships, how to leverage your internship experience, and how to prepare for full-time interviews.

### **Chapter 10: How To Progress Towards Senior**

This chapter explains how to transition from a junior developer to a senior developer, including what skills and mindset you need to develop, how to take initiative, and how to own your career growth.

## My Background and Bias

I’m not a professor. I’m not an author. And I haven’t been in the industry for decades.

I’m just a student who has been through the same struggles you’re facing right now and I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to navigate the tech job market as a student.

I have spent the last several years talking to students—thousands of them—about their fears, frustrations, and hopes for their future in tech. I've been more involved in the student community than most, spending the past 8 years working with students at Carleton University, giving talks, running workshops, and mentoring students one-on-one.

I’ve worked in industry now for 6-ish years now at every kind of organization, from startups with four people in a room, government roles, mid-size SaaS companies, to large-scale companies like Shopify and GitLab.

I've done countless internship and full-time developer interviews, have now successfully landed two full-time job searches post pandemic, and I’ve watched countless talented friends go through the same struggles I did.

I'm also Canadian, and the hiring landscape in Canada is different than it is in the U.S., so some of the perspectives in this guide may reflect that.

And finally: I’m not claiming this is the perfect resource. I’m not a professional educator, and I’m sure there are ways this could be better written, better researched, or more comprehensive.

But my goal here isn’t to be polished—it’s to be helpful. This guide is my attempt to take everything I’ve learned and everything I’ve seen, and make it easier for the next wave of students to get through it all.
