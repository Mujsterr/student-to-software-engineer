# 1. Introduction

Landing your first job as a software engineer has never been more challenging.

A computer science degree no longer guarantees a job, and trying to piece everything together from scattered YouTube tutorials and blog posts can leave you overwhelmed and unsure of where to start.

This guide is here to change that.

Whether you're just starting university or already deep in your job search, this guide will help you cut through the noise, avoid common pitfalls, and build a focused, strategic path from student to software engineer.

## Why Does This Handbook Exist?

If you're a student or early in your career, you might think it's obvious why there are no jobs.

Economic instability, mass layoffs, and the rise of AI are definitely contributing factors, however the root of the problem is deeper and has been present long before the pandemic and AI were ever a concern.

The reality is most students coming out of university were never prepared for industry, it's just that developers were in such high demand that it didn't matter.

Now, with the job market being flooded with developers, the lack of preparation is becoming painfully obvious.

Students lack the context and skills needed to present themselves effectively to employers and stand out from the competition.

However, it's not hopeless. Tech is an extremely accessible field to self-educate in, and there are plenty of resources available to help you build the skills you need.

The biggest challenge is knowing where to start, which is exactly what this handbook aims to solve.
