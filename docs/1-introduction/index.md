# 1. Introduction

Landing your first job as a software engineer has never been more challenging.

A computer science degree no longer guarantees a job and self teaching is overwhelming thanks to the saturation of conflicting resources and advice.

This guide is here to change that.

Whether you're just starting university or already deep in your job search, this guide will give you a clear roadmap from student to software engineer.

## I Don't Have Time To Read 200+ Pages

If you're thinking "I don't have time to read 200+ pages", I get it.

This is the key takeaway: _If you want to be hired as a software engineer, you need to show that you can build, test, deploy, and maintain **real software**._ This is what actual software engineers do every day, and this is what employers want to see.

Of the thousands of students I've talked to, so many have unfocused resumes and no understanding of what employers actually want. They build projects, but do not demonstrate skills past an understanding of how to build some "frontend, backend, database CRUD app".

Your "frontend, backend, database CRUD app" is just the tip of the iceberg.

Show employers you can build real software by demonstrating your understanding of:

- Automated Testing: Unit Tests, Integration Tests, End-to-End Tests
- API Protocols: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets
- Datastores: Relational Databases, Caches, Search Engines
- Background Tasks: Cron Jobs, Message Queues, etc
- Cloud Services: S3, EC2, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes, etc
- Observability tools: Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting
- Architecture Patterns: Microservices, Monoliths, Serverless, etc

If these are new to you, **great** — now you have a clear path to grow into what employers want.

Yes, there are less entry level jobs. Economic instability, overwhelming growth in university enrollment, mass layoffs, and the rise of AI are definitely contributing factors, but another root of the problem is students having the perception the theoretical knowledge from their computer science degree is enough to get hired.

The bar is higher now that developers are in less demand and university students lack the context and skills needed to present themselves effectively to employers and stand out from the competition.

However, it's not hopeless. Tech is an extremely accessible field to self-educate in, **the biggest challenge is not being overwhelmed by the sheer volume** of information and conflicting advice.

This guide aims to give you the words to research in a logical order that builds on itself, so you can learn the skills that employers actually care about.

## What This Book Covers

The chapters are structured to build on each other. Each one answers a different set of questions that students commonly face on their career journey:

### [Chapter 1: Introduction](./index.md)

This chapter explains what a software engineer is, the difference between computer science and software engineering, and why understanding this distinction is crucial for your career.

### [Chapter 2: Why It’s So Hard To Get Hired](../2-landscape-of-tech-employment/index.md)

This chapter explains why the job market is saturated with developers, and most aren't getting hired. This chapter explains the big-picture reasons why: skyrocketing university enrollment, AI, industry shifts, and a mismatch between what schools teach and what employers need.

### [Chapter 3: How To Make The Most Of University](../3-maximizing-university-experience/index.md)

This chapter covers how university can (and can’t) prepare you for your career. It covers how you need to do more than just focus on good grades, but also build a portfolio, network, and gain relevant experience that will help you land your first job.

### [Chapter 4: Understanding the Workplace](../4-understanding-the-tech-industry/index.md)

To succeed not only in finding a job, but also a job you actually enjoy, you need to understand what roles exist, how teams are structured, and most importantly what is actually expected of junior developers.

### [Chapter 5: The Skills You Need To Get Hired](../5-technical-skill-roadmap/index.md)

This chapter is structured as a massive checklist of the skills you need to get hired, their justifications, and how to learn them.

### [Chapter 6: Gain Experience Without a Job](../6-gaining-experience-without-formal-employment/index.md)

### [Chapter 7: Find Your First Internship](../7-find-your-first-internship/index.md)

This chapter covers how to apply for internships, what to include in your resume, how to prepare for interviews, and how to stand out from the competition. It also includes tips for networking and leveraging connections.
