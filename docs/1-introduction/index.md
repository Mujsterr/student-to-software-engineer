# 1. Introduction

Landing your first software job has never been harder.

A computer science degree is no longer a guaranteed ticket to employment and trying to learn everything on your own—through an endless sea of YouTube tutorials, blog posts, and conflicting advice—can feel overwhelming and directionless.

This book is here to help you cut through the noise.

Whether you're just beginning your university journey or already deep in the job hunt, this guide is designed to help you chart a clear, strategic path from student to software engineer.

## What This Book Covers

The chapters are structured to build on each other. Each one answers a different set of questions that students commonly face on their career journey:

### **Chapter 2: Why It’s So Hard To Get Hired**

We start with brutal honesty. The job market is flooded with students, and most aren't getting hired. This chapter explains the big-picture reasons why: skyrocketing enrollment, AI, industry shifts, and a mismatch between what schools teach and what employers need.

### **Chapter 3: How To Make The Most Of University**

Before you panic about jobs, we zoom in on your current reality. This chapter explains how university can (and can’t) prepare you for your career, and how to make the most of your time there—academically, socially, and strategically.

### **Chapter 4: Understanding the Field**

The tech industry is huge, but most students have only seen a tiny sliver of it. This chapter breaks down the types of roles, domains, and team structures you’ll encounter in industry, so you can start figuring out what kind of work actually excites you.

### **Chapter 5: The Skills You Need To Get Hired**

Once you understand the game, you’ll need to level up. This section outlines the actual technical and professional skills employers look for—and how to assess and improve your own. It’s broken into core computer science concepts, project development, communication, and collaboration.

### **Chapter 6: Gain Experience Without a Job**

This chapter focuses on how to build your resume and portfolio even if you haven’t had a formal job yet. It covers personal projects, open-source contributions, and other ways to demonstrate your skills and initiative.

### **Chapter 7: Find Your First Internship**

You’ll likely run into the “entry-level job that requires 2 years of experience” paradox. This chapter shows you how to break in anyway—through open-source, personal projects, volunteer work, or non-traditional internships.

### **Chapter 8: Final Year Strategy**

When graduation is close, things get serious. This chapter helps you prioritize how to spend your final semesters to maximize your chances of landing full-time work before (or soon after) finishing school.

## How to Use This Book

You don’t have to read every chapter in order, but you’ll get the most value if you do. Each section is short, direct, and focused on **what you need to know**, **why it matters**, and **what to do next**.

Where relevant, you’ll also find:

- Self-assessments to track your progress
- Side notes for students in different situations (e.g., no internships yet, switching majors, going to bootcamp)
- Concrete examples, templates, and workflows you can copy and adapt
