# 1.2. You Need To Learn To Build Software

If your goal is to become a software engineer, you need to learn the different components that make up a software system.

It sounds simple, but due to a lack of guidance, many students lack this key understanding.

Think of it this way:

- In order to be a car mechanic, you need to learn how different parts of a car work and fit together.
- In order to become a doctor, you need to learn how the human body works and how to diagnose illnesses.
- In order to become a chef, you need to learn how different ingredients pair together and how to use various cooking techniques.

A computer scientist who doesn't know the components of a software is like:

- a mechanic who doesn't know what an engine is
- a chef who doesn't know what ingredients exist
- a doctor who doesn't know the parts of the human body.

**No wonder no one wants to hire you.**

Your degree focuses on the fundamentals of computer science, it will likely **NOT** teach you the components of software systems, how to put them together, or how to build something useful.

This is where the gap lies in how many students present themselves to employers. Even those who do have the skills often struggle to communicate their abilities effectively.

In this handbook, we will cover the key components of software systems, how they fit together, and how to present your skills in a way that resonates with employers.

[Chapter 5](../5-technical-skill-roadmap/index.md) will cover what parts make up apps and how you get get started learning each of them.

[Chapter 6](../6-gaining-experience-without-formal-employment/index.md) will cover the best ways to gain real experience building software without a job.

[Chapter 7](../7-find-your-first-internship/index.md) will cover how to find your first internship and how to present your skills effectively.
