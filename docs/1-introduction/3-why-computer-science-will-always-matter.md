# 1.3. Computer Science Will Always Matter

Even as the tech industry shifts toward integration, data, and AI, one thing remains true: **a strong foundation in computer science is more valuable than ever.**

In a world full of high-level tools and services, it might be tempting to think you don’t need to understand how things work under the hood. But the most effective people in modern tech teams _do_ understand the fundamentals—even if they’re not writing low-level code every day.

Why? Because **every tool, framework, and service is built on top of core computing principles.** Algorithms, data structures, memory management, distributed systems, concurrency—these aren’t just academic exercises. They’re the backbone of everything that powers the internet, and they give you the intuition to troubleshoot problems, optimize systems, and reason about trade-offs when things go wrong.

A computer science degree doesn’t just teach you how to write code. It teaches you how to **think like a developer**: how to model complex problems, reason about efficiency, and understand the abstract structures that govern software.

That matters in every field:

- Want to work in AI? You’ll need to understand linear algebra, probability, and the performance trade-offs of large systems.
- Want to build secure systems? You’ll need to know about encryption, protocols, and memory safety.
- Want to integrate ten SaaS products into a working system? You’ll need to understand APIs, event flows, and failure recovery.

CS isn’t just one track. It’s the root that supports all the branches.

Even if you end up in a role that’s more operational than creative, your CS foundation gives you the confidence to go deeper when you need to. It’s what separates the people who _follow tutorials_ from the people who _really understand what’s going on._

And in a job market where you’ll need to adapt constantly, **that understanding is your most durable advantage.**
