# 1.1. What is a Software Engineer?

A software engineer is someone who designs, develops, tests, and maintains software systems.

Some examples of software systems include web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, cloud services and infrastructure, embedded systems, operating systems, developer tools, and a lot more.

Software engineers use programming languages and tools to build software that meets user needs and solves real-world problems. They collaborate with other team members, such as designers, product managers, and quality assurance testers, to create high-quality software products.

We will dive deeper into the all of these different ideas in chapter 4: "understanding the tech workplace" but for now, it is important to understand that software engineering is an applied discipline.

## Computer Science vs Software Engineering

A lot of the students and I talk to have the mindset of "just wanting a job in tech" and their idea of a "job in tech" is often a _programmer_.

While programming is a part of being a software engineer, it's one of many possible roles that are made possible with a background in computer science which is why It's important to understand that just having a degree in computer science does not make you a software engineer.

Software engineering is a field that is built on top of computer science. They are not one in the same, but they are closely related.

Computer science is a theoretical discipline that focuses on the principles of computation, algorithms, data structures, and the underlying mathematics of computing. It provides a foundation for understanding how computers work and how to solve problems using computational methods.

Software Engineers build software systems that solve real-world problems, while Computer Scientists study the theoretical aspects of computation and develop new algorithms and techniques that can be applied in software engineering.

For example, a Computer Scientist might develop a new algorithm for sorting data more efficiently, while a Software Engineer would utilize that algorithm in a real-world application.

Here's a simple analogy to help clarify the difference:

Software Engineering is built off of Computer Science in the same way Physics is built off of Mathematics.

Knowing how to do complicated math proofs doesn't mean you know the physics to build a bridge, and knowing how to write a sorting algorithm doesn't mean you can build an app.
