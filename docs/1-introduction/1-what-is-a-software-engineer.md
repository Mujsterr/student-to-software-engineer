# 1.1. What is a Software Engineer?

Before you even read this book, you need to understand what a software engineer is and whether this is actually the job you want.

A lot of the students and young professionals I talk to have the mindset of "just wanting a job in tech" and their idea of a "job in tech" is often a _programmer_.

While programming is a part of being a software engineer, it's one of many possible roles that are made possible with a background in computer science which is why It's important to understand that **just having a degree in computer science does not make you a software engineer**.

## What Does a Software Engineer Do?

A software engineer is someone who designs, develops, tests, and maintains software systems.

Some examples of software systems include web applications, mobile apps, desktop software, cloud services and infrastructure, embedded systems, operating systems, developer tools, and a lot more.

Software engineers use programming languages and tools to build software that meets user needs and solves real-world problems. They collaborate with other team members, such as designers, product managers, and quality assurance testers, to create high-quality software products.

We will dive deeper into the all of these different ideas in chapter 4: "understanding the tech workplace" but for now, it is important to understand that software engineering is an applied discipline.

## Computer Science vs Software Engineering

Software engineering is field that is built on top of computer science. They are not one in the same, but they are closely related.

Computer science is a theoretical discipline that focuses on the principles of computation, algorithms, data structures, and the underlying mathematics of computing. It provides a foundation for understanding how computers work and how to solve problems using computational methods.

Software Engineers build software systems that solve real-world problems, while Computer Scientists study the theoretical aspects of computation and develop new algorithms and techniques that can be applied in software engineering.

For example, a Computer Scientist might develop a new algorithm for sorting data more efficiently, while a Software Engineer would utilize that algorithm in a real-world application.

Here's a simple analogy to help clarify the difference:

Software Engineering is built off of Computer Science in the same way Physics is built off of Mathematics, and Chemistry is built off of Physics.

Knowing how to do complicated math proofs doesn't mean you know the physics to build a bridge, and knowing how to write a sorting algorithm doesn't mean you can build an app.

## Computer Science Is Not Employable By Default

Ask yourself, have you ever seen a job posting for a "Computer Scientist"? Probably not.

While a computer science degree provides a critical foundation, it does not, on its own, make students employable in the tech industry.

Although there are many jobs in tech, the vast majority are for roles like **Software Engineers**, **Data Scientists**, **Security Analysts**, and **Site Reliability Engineers**—not “Computer Scientists.”

A lot of students enter computer science programs and graduate without ever properly understanding this distinction. They believe that simply getting a CS degree is enough to secure a job in tech. But that was only ever true during periods of explosive hiring, and it’s no longer the case.

To make it in today's job market, it's really on you "the student" to fill in your gaps for your desired career path with real applied experience and practical skills.

Chapter 5 of this book will cover how to do that, but for now, it's important to understand that **computer science is a foundation, not a career**.
