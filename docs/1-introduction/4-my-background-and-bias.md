# 1.4. My Background and Bias

Before we get into the details, I want to acknowledge the biases that come from my own background.

I’m not a professor. I’m not an author. And I haven’t been in the industry for decades. But I have spent the last several years talking to students—thousands of them—about their fears, frustrations, and hopes for their future in tech. I’ve helped people prep for interviews, rewrite resumes, and figure out how to navigate an increasingly confusing job market. And I’ve spent a lot of time listening. Probably more than most.

For over five years, I was an executive with the Carleton Computer Science Society, including time as President. Even after graduating, I’ve continued helping out—advising student groups, running mentorship initiatives, and organizing career events. I’ve stayed close to the community because I know how isolating and overwhelming it can be to try and break into tech on your own.

I’ve also seen the job market from multiple angles. I’ve worked at tiny startups where there were four of us in a room, at mid-size SaaS companies like Jobber, in government roles, and at large-scale companies like Shopify and GitLab. I’ve been through the junior developer job crisis twice now and have watched talented friends go through the same struggles I did. I’ve seen what works, what doesn’t, and how the industry is changing.

That said, I’m Canadian, and that comes with its own lens. The hiring landscape in Canada is different than it is in the U.S., so some of the perspectives in this guide will reflect that.

And finally: I’m not claiming this is the perfect resource. I’m not a professional educator, and I’m sure there are ways this could be better written, better researched, or more comprehensive. But my goal here isn’t to be polished—it’s to be helpful. This guide is my attempt to take everything I’ve learned and everything I’ve seen, and make it easier for the next wave of students to get through it all.
