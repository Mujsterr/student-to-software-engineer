# 1.3. "Do I Want To Be A Software Engineer?"

I meet so many students who tell me, _“I just want any job”_ or _“I just want to get hired.”_

Before you spend time reading this book, it’s important to understand that much of what I’ve written is aimed at students who have decided, _“I want to be a software engineer.”_

Software engineering is just one of many paths in computer science. It might not be the right fit for you — and that’s perfectly okay.

The ideas in this book can help you no matter what role you’re aiming for: software engineer, data scientist, cybersecurity analyst, or anything else. The core philosophy is simple:

> _If you want to get hired, you need to show you can do the real work of that job._

For **software engineering**, that means demonstrating you can build, test, deploy, and maintain real software systems.

For **data science**, it might mean building models, analyzing datasets, and working with machine learning tools.

The reason this book focuses on software engineering is because that’s where my experience lies. After working as a software engineer for eight years, I’ve seen what’s missing from most student resumes — and what skills employers actually care about.

I'm not qualified to give advice on the path to becoming a data scientist, cybersecurity analyst, or other roles.

However, the core principles of building real projects, gaining relevant experience, and effectively communicating your skills apply across the board.

Even if you don't know if you want to be a software engineer, I'm confident you'll still find value in this book, but certain sections like [Chapter 5 (The Skills You Need To Get Hired)](../5-technical-skill-roadmap/index.md) might not be as relevant to you.
