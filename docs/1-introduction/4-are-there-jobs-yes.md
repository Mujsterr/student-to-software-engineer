# 1.4. Will There Be Jobs? Yes.

Yes, there are jobs in tech—and there always will be.

But that doesn’t mean things are staying the same. The types of roles that exist in the industry are shifting, and so are the skills that are in demand. The “traditional” image of a software developer—someone who writes original code for a brand-new app—still exists, but it's going to slowly become less common.

Let’s take a closer look at where the industry is heading.

## Abstraction and The Rise of "Operators"

As the tech industry has matured, the tools and frameworks available to developers have become more powerful and efficient.

Additionally common areas of work that used to require full engineering teams have been turned into SaaS products and businesses. Need to process payments? Stripe. Need user authentication and identity management? Okta. Need a full data warehouse? Snowflake. Want to deploy your code? Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc. all have you covered.

As these tools become more reliable and more powerful, companies need fewer people to build things from scratch. The recent productivity boost that AI tools and LLMs are providing has further reduced the number of developers needed to build new products.

Instead, they need people who are really good at _wiring everything together_—people who understand how to configure services, respond to issues, monitor performance, and keep the entire system stable. These aren’t traditional “software engineering” roles. They're more like _software operations_.

Right now, many companies still reimplement the same features over and over again: authentication, notifications, analytics dashboards, email templates, etc. But that’s slowly changing. Every time a new standardized SaaS product enters the market, it replaces something that used to require in-house code.

As this trend continues, fewer engineers will be needed to write foundational features. More and more of the value will come from integrating existing tools in a smart way—not from building everything from zero.

This doesn’t mean software engineers are going extinct. It just means the baseline level of abstraction is rising.

You might have heard of job titles like "Site Reliability Engineer" (SRE) or "Platform Engineer." It's likely that a greater expectation will be put on the responsibilities associated with these roles as hard to replace skills like diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring reliability become more critical.

## Is Software Engineering Dead? No.

No, software engineering isn’t dead. It’s just evolving.

Someone will always need to add new features to the services mentioned above, and there will always be companies that need custom software built for their specific needs.

The reality is just that there will be less need for Software Engineers then there has been.

## Data Science and AI

While the hype around “AI replacing engineers” is often exaggerated, it's true that AI is reshaping the kinds of jobs available and has had an impact on the expectations of software engineers.

It's becoming a growing expectation that software engineers be capable of using AI tools to improve their work and know how to integrate AI into their applications.

The reality is that all these fancy models are really just another "component of software" that needs to be integrated, maintained, and optimized, a like to other components like databases, messaging queues, etc.

## The Lost Art of Systems Work

While SaaS and cloud tools are eating up most of the application-layer work, there are still critical areas of computing that are quietly starving for talent.

Operating systems. Kernels. Networking stacks. Compiler design. These are fields where expertise is vanishing—often lumped under vague terms like “DevOps” or “platform engineering.”

It’s easy to forget, but every flashy web app still depends on thousands of layers of foundational software to function. These low-level components don’t change much, but when they do, it’s hard work—and it takes a certain kind of engineer to do it right.

With how much the industry has shifted toward high-level abstractions, many students never even learn about these foundational areas. They focus on high level areas like web development and data science, leaving behind the core principles that make all of it possible.

Despite their being jobs in this area, fewer students pursue this path because today it's harder to learn, and not as glamorous. But the industry desperately needs more people in these areas. If you want to stand out, this is a place where deep knowledge can still command serious respect.

## So… Are There Jobs?

Yes. But they might not necessarily be the jobs you imagined when you started studying computer science. They're not all about building the next big app from scratch.

The opportunity is still there—but to seize it, you need to understand the direction the industry is heading.

## Computer Science Will Always Matter

If you’re worried that your computer science degree is becoming obsolete, don’t be. The fundamentals of computing are timeless. Understanding algorithms, data structures, and the principles of software design will always be valuable.

As long as there are computers, there will be a need for people with a background in computer science.

The jobs that exist today will change, and the tools we use will evolve, but the fundamental principles of computing will remain constant which is why your computer science degree is going to keep its value and it's essential for anyone looking to build a career in technology.

In a world full of high-level tools and services, it might be tempting to think you don’t need to understand how things work under the hood. But the most effective people in modern tech teams _do_ understand the fundamentals—even if they’re not writing low-level code every day.

Based on how the industry is shifting right now, it's fairly easy to predict thats the jobs that exist in 20 years are going to be different from the jobs that exist today, and it's your understanding of the fundamentals that will allow you to adapt and thrive in that changing landscape.

It's also important to keep in mind that your degree is not just about pure knowledge. Going through university is about learning how to learn and how to think critically. It's about building a network of peers and mentors who can support you throughout your career.

In chapter 3, we'll discuss how to make the most of university, both academically and socially, so you can build the skills and connections that will help you succeed in your career.
