# 1.2. Will There Be Jobs? Yes.

Yes, there are jobs in tech—and there always will be.

But that doesn’t mean things are staying the same. The types of roles that exist in the industry are shifting, and so are the skills that are in demand. The “traditional” image of a software developer—someone who writes original code for a brand-new app—still exists, but it’s becoming less common.

Let’s take a closer look at where the industry is heading.

## Decline of Developers, Rise of "Operators"

As the tech industry has matured, the tools and frameworks available to developers have become more powerful and efficient.

Additionally common areas of work that used to require full engineering teams have been turned into SaaS products and businesses. Need to process payments? Stripe. Need user authentication and identity management? Okta. Need a full data warehouse? Snowflake. Want to deploy your code? Vercel, Netlify, and AWS all have you covered.

As these tools become more reliable and more powerful, companies need fewer people to build things from scratch. The recent productivity boost that AI tools and LLMs are providing has further reduced the number of developers needed to build new products.

Instead, they need people who are really good at _wiring everything together_—people who understand how to configure services, respond to issues, monitor performance, and keep the entire system stable. These aren’t traditional “software engineering” roles. They're more like _software operations_.

Right now, many companies still reimplement the same features over and over again: authentication, notifications, analytics dashboards, email templates, etc. But that’s slowly changing. Every time a new standardized SaaS product enters the market, it replaces something that used to require in-house code.

As this trend continues, fewer engineers will be needed to write foundational features. More and more of the value will come from integrating existing tools in a smart way—not from building everything from zero.

This doesn’t mean software engineers are going extinct. It just means the baseline level of abstraction is rising. The industry is moving from "builders" to "orchestrators."

Today we have the role of "Site Reliability Engineer" (SRE), which has existed now for decades, but is far less common than the title "Software Engineer." SREs are responsible for ensuring that systems run smoothly, but they don’t necessarily write new code every day. Instead, they focus on maintaining and optimizing existing systems.

## Is Software Engineering Dead? No.

No, software engineering isn’t dead. It’s just evolving.

Someone will always need to add new features to the services mentioned above, and there will always be companies that need custom software built for their specific needs.

The reality is just that there will be less need for Software Engineers then there has been.

## The Steady Rise of Data and AI

One area where demand isn’t slowing down is data—and especially AI. Companies are collecting more data than ever, and they need people who know how to work with it: from cleaning and analyzing data to building models and deploying them in production.

While the hype around “AI replacing engineers” is often exaggerated, it's true that AI is reshaping the kinds of jobs available. There’s growing demand for people who understand how to _use_ AI tools effectively, how to build reliable pipelines, how to tune models, and how to make them usable inside real applications.

In short: AI isn’t entirely killing jobs. It’s changing what they look like.

## Forgotten Foundations: The Lost Art of Systems Work

While SaaS and cloud tools are eating up most of the application-layer work, there are still critical areas of computing that are quietly starving for talent.

Operating systems. Kernels. Networking stacks. Compiler design. These are fields where expertise is vanishing—often lumped under vague terms like “DevOps” or “platform engineering.”

It’s easy to forget, but every flashy web app still depends on thousands of layers of foundational software to function. These low-level components don’t change much, but when they do, it’s hard work—and it takes a certain kind of engineer to do it right.

With how much the industry has shifted toward high-level abstractions, many students never even learn about these foundational areas. They focus on web development, mobile apps, and data science, leaving behind the core principles that make all of it possible.

Despite their being jobs in this area, fewer students pursue this path because today it's harder to learn, and not as glamorous. But the industry desperately needs more people in these areas. If you want to stand out, this is a place where deep knowledge can still command serious respect.

## So… Are There Jobs?

Yes. But they might not necessarily be the jobs you imagined when you started studying computer science. They're not all about building the next big app from scratch.

The opportunity is still there—but to seize it, you need to understand the direction the industry is heading.
