# 9. Full-Time Job Search

There are many similarities between searching for a full-time job and searching for an internship, but there are also some key differences.

A good chunk of the advice in section 7 applies to full-time job searching as well, but there are some additional things to keep in mind.

## 9.1. When to Search

Unlike internships, full-time job searches are more flexible in terms of timing.

Companies do not have the immediate pressure caused by the academic calendar, so they can hire at any time of the year.

Because they are hiring for permanent positions, they are also more likely to wait for the right candidate rather than rushing to fill a position.

The process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, so it's important to start early and be patient.
