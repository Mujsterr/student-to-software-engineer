# 8.4.1. There Are Bad Questions

When you join a team, you might hear the phrase, “there are no bad questions.” While the intent behind this sentiment is to encourage curiosity, it’s not entirely accurate. The way you ask questions can leave a lasting impression, and asking poorly thought-out or vague questions can reflect negatively on you.

Good questions demonstrate that you’ve put effort into understanding the problem before seeking help. They show that you’re thoughtful, resourceful, and respectful of others’ time.

For example, instead of asking, “Why isn’t this working?” try asking, “I’m getting this specific error when I run my code, and here’s what I’ve tried to resolve so far. Could you help me understand what I might be missing?”

Before asking a question, try…

- Searching for the issue within your company’s documentation platform
- Searching for the issue within your company’s message app (Slack, MS Teams)

By showing that you’ve taken the initiative to research, test, or troubleshoot, you signal to your team that you’re proactive and committed to learning.

Consistently asking questions without context or preparation suggests a lack of independence or effort, which can erode trust over time.
