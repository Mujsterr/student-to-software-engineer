# 8.4.7. Participate in Code Reviews

As an intern, you might not feel comfortable or ready to contribute to code reviews. It’s natural to worry about saying the wrong thing or not understanding enough to provide valuable feedback. But remember, no one expects you to be an expert as a newcomer. Code reviews are not just about spotting issues—they’re also an excellent learning opportunity for you.

A great way to get involved in code reviews is simply by asking thoughtful questions. If you’re unsure about why something was implemented a certain way, ask for clarification.

If you’re struggling to think of questions, start small. Look for areas in the code where you could use more context, such as:

- A function name or variable that seems unclear.
- A logic flow that feels complex or unfamiliar.
- A new pattern you don’t fully understand.

At the very least, just read code reviews. Pay attention to how other team members provide feedback during reviews. Notice the types of comments they leave and over time, you’ll gain confidence and start contributing more meaningfully.
