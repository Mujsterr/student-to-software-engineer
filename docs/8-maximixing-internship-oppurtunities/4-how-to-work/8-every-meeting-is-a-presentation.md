# 8.4.7. Every Meeting is a Presentation

Come to every meeting prepared.

Treat every meeting you need to speak in like a presentation.

If you’re expected to speak—even for a brief update—take the time to organize your thoughts beforehand. Be concise, clear, and confident in your delivery.

If you’re organizing a meeting—even a brief one—make sure you’ve created an agenda with clearly identified questions or outcomes you need from the meeting.

Meetings aren’t just about exchanging information; they’re moments to leave a positive impression, establish yourself as a valuable team member, and build trust with your team.
