# 8.4.4. Take Ownership and Clarify Details Early

One of the most common pitfalls for interns, junior developers—and even seasoned programmers—is diving into implementation before fully understanding the requirements or assumptions behind a task. Instead, you should take ownership and work to fully understand a ticket’s scope and ensure that all requirements are met when it’s delivered.

You do not want to tell your team your ticket is almost done, only for your entire approach to be questioned once you submit your first draft of the code for review. You also don’t want to mark a ticket complete while missing a part of an acceptance critiria and potentially derail future dependant tickets in your team’s backlog.

If a ticket has ambigious requirements, hop in a call with the developer, designer, or product manager who wrote the ticket to clarify when you have a question.

For design or product driven tasks, share screenshots and video updates to confirm you’re meeting their vision before completing the task. This iterative approach avoids spending hours building something that doesn’t meet their needs.

By seeking clarification early and staying aligned with your team, you’ll build trust with your colleagues and have more time to take on a greater breadth of tickets.
