# 8.4.6. Don't Have Too Many Tickets in Flight

Aim to keep no more than two tickets in progress at a time.

The final 5–10% of a ticket can often be the most challenging, requiring extra effort to address edge cases, resolve loose ends, or finalize documentation. Additionally, once a ticket reaches the code review stage, it may go through several iterations of feedback, potentially adding days of additional work.

Start by focusing on one ticket. Only take on a second if:

- Your first ticket has reached the code review stage.
- Your current ticket is blocked and will likely remain so for more than a few days.

Some valid reasons for taking on a second ticket might include waiting for:

- Alignment from another team on the ticket’s direction.
- Input or clarification from stakeholders.

If you know a ticket is going to be blocked for an extended period (e.g., over a week) and it’s unclear when it will be unblocked, let your manager know and ask to be unassigned and explain the situation and the uncertainty around resolution timelines.
