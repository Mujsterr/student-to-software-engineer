# 8. Maximizing Internships

Your first internship can feel like a blur.

You’re dropped into an unfamiliar team, expected to learn fast, and often left wondering what actually matters. Should you focus on shipping code? Impressing your manager? Learning as much as you can? Making friends?

The truth is: an internship is more than just work experience. It’s a test-drive.

It’s your chance to see what it’s like working on a real team, building real software, and navigating real office dynamics. And at the same time, it’s the company’s chance to evaluate whether they might want to bring you back full-time.

Most students treat internships passively—they show up, do what’s asked, and hope for the best. But if you’re intentional about how you approach your internship, you can leave with more than just a paycheck. You can walk away with a return offer, great references, a stronger resume, and a clearer sense of what kind of team or role actually excites you.

This chapter is everything I wish I had known before starting my first internship. You’ll learn how to onboard effectively, ask better questions, get real work, and make a lasting impression on your team.
