# 8.3.3. Advocate for Breadth of Work

If you’re new to a codebase, it’s easy to get pigeonholed into working on similar tasks or focusing on a specific area, especially as an intern who hasn’t yet built trust with your team members.

During most software engineering internships, you’ll likely have time to complete only a handful of tasks, making it crucial to advocate for opportunities that allow you to work on diverse tasks and interact with different technologies across your team’s system.

For example, if your team is building an app with both frontend and backend components, try not to limit yourself to just backend work.

Throughout your internship, think about how your experiences will shape your resume. Are there skills or technologies that would make you more employable in the future if you gained experience with them now?

Also consider what you’ve done in previous internships. If you already have experience with a given technology or area of the stack, make sure you’re learning something different during your current internship.

If your workplace doesn’t naturally offer opportunities to explore different areas, consider raising this with your manager or mentor during a 1:1 meeting.
