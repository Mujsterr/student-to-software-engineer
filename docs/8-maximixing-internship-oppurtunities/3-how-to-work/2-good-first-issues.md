# 8.3.2 Start With Good First Issues & Pairing

Starting in a new codebase can feel overwhelming, but there are ways to ease the transition and make a strong impression on your team.

When starting out in a new codebase, I recommend asking to pair program with one of the full-time developers on your team while working on “good first issue” tickets when they are busy.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming involves collaborating with a teammate to work through a piece of code together.

Ask to pair program with one of the full-time developers on your team. This is a great way to get an applied understanding of your team’s immediate work as opposed to reading through documentation or getting an oral overview of the codebase.

## Good First Issues

“Good first issues” are curated tasks designed to be approachable for new contributors. These tickets are typically non-urgent, low-risk, and great opportunities to get familiar with the codebase while contributing something meaningful.

Once your development environment is set up, proactively ask your mentor or engineering manager for good first issues to work on. Emphasize that you’re looking for tasks that won’t block your team or have tight deadlines, as these are ideal for ramping up.

Not every team has a list of curated tasks ready for new members. If that’s the case, bring up the idea early. By asking for good first issues, you encourage your manager or mentor to prepare tasks that will help you contribute sooner.
