# 8.3.5. Pair on Tickets Outside Your Depth

As an intern, you’re going to see tickets that you just don’t feel you have the experience to take on.

It’s tempting to avoid these tickets to avoid slowing down the team or making mistakes. However, these tickets often provide the most valuable learning opportunities and can accelerate your growth as a developer.

Instead of shying away, consider taking a proactive approach: while continuing to work on tickets within your comfort zone, ask your teammates if it’s possible to pair program on the more challenging tickets.

Especially for tickets like research tasks or spikes, it’s great to pair with someone so you can observe how they break down ambiguous problems, structure their research, and prioritize key insights.
