# 3.1. Stop Chasing Grades, Build Your Future

Up until now — especially in high school — grades have probably been one of your main motivators. They mattered because you needed them to get into university.

But now you’re here. So… now what?

For the first time, grades are no longer the end goal. Your real goal is to build the skills, experience, and the network that will actually help you build your career.

Most students don’t realize this early enough. They fall into the trap of treating university like high school: go to class, get good grades, move on.

But here’s the hard truth — **good grades alone aren’t enough.** In fact, they’re _less than the bare minimum_ if you want to stand out in tech.

A company would much rather hire a B or C student who can actually build things than an A+ student who can only recite theory. Everyone around you is taking the same classes, doing the same assignments, and aiming for the same grades. To stand out, you have to do more.

Think of it this way: you might be getting **As** in your courses, but if you had to grade your career growth so far, it might look more like a **C**.

That doesn’t mean you should skip class or tank your GPA. It means shifting your mindset about what university is really for. Instead of obsessing over grades, focus on building the skills and experiences that actually make you employable.

## When Do Grades Matter?

While grades aren’t your golden ticket to a job in tech, they aren’t useless either. There are times when keeping your GPA up genuinely helps:

- If you’re unsure about CS and might want to switch programs, solid grades give you more flexibility.
- If you plan to apply for a master’s or PhD program, strong academics are often required.
- Research positions, scholarships, and awards often filter candidates by GPA before even looking at resumes or portfolios.
- Many co-op programs have minimum GPA requirements. Some companies still use GPA as a hiring filter for entry-level jobs.
- Certain government jobs or highly specialized roles may require specific academic thresholds.
- If aiming for good grades helps keep you disciplined and motivated, that’s a valid reason — just don’t let it become the _only_ thing you focus on.

Strong grades keep doors open. So while you don’t need a perfect GPA, don’t let your academics completely slide, especially in first year. Early courses are often easier, and doing well gives you a GPA cushion and good study habits. Starting strong makes life a lot easier down the road when the material gets harder.

**In short:** do well enough early so you can afford to ease up later.
