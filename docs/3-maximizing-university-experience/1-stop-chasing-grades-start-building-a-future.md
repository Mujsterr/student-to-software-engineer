# 3.1. Stop Chasing Grades, Start Building a Future

Up until this point and especially during your time in high school—you probably haven’t had to seriously ask yourself why you're doing any of this.

You got good grades because you were supposed to. Because you needed them to get into university. That was the next step. It was obvious.

But now you’re here. So… now what?

For the first time, the path ahead isn’t so clear. You're not just working toward a grade anymore. You're working toward something. But what? A degree? A job? A life?

Most students don’t stop to think about this early enough. They treat university like high school: go to class, get good grades, move on. But here’s the problem—grades don’t matter nearly as much as you think they do. Not in the way they used to.

**Just getting good grades is less than the bare minimum.** It’s not enough to get you a job in tech. In fact, it’s not even enough to get you an interview at most companies.

Everyone around you is doing the same courses as you, so you need to do more to actually stand out.

You may be getting a **As** in your courses, but in regards to the grade you would receive on your career growth, it's probably closer to a **C**.

That doesn’t mean skipping class or flunking your courses. It means rethinking what university is for.

## When Do Grades Matter?

While it's true that grades aren’t the golden ticket to a job in tech, that doesn’t mean they’re completely irrelevant.

There are a few clear situations where your grades do matter:

- If you're unsure whether computer science is right for you, keeping your grades up gives you the flexibility to transfer into a different program.

- If you’re planning to apply for a master’s program, strong academic performance is often a requirement.

- Many academic opportunities—like research positions, scholarships, or awards—use GPA as a first filter, often before even looking at your resume or portfolio.

- Co-op programs and internships often have minimum GPA requirements and some companies do use GPA as a screening tool in their hiring process for entry-level positions.

In these cases, grades do genuinely keep the doors open for these opportunities. So while you shouldn’t obsess over having a perfect GPA, don’t let your academics completely slide, especially if you’re keeping those doors open.

I also recommend trying to keep your grades decently high early on—even if you don’t plan to. First-year courses are usually the easiest, and doing well in them gives you a GPA cushion and builds the study habits you’ll need later. If you start off weak, it’s a lot harder to recover later when the material gets more complex and the curve gets steeper.

**In short:** do well enough early so you can afford to slack later (if you need to).
