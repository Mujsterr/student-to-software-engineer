# 3.1.1.1. When Do Grades Matter?

While it's true that grades aren’t the golden ticket to a job in tech, that doesn’t mean they’re completely irrelevant.

There are a few clear situations where your grades do matter:

- If you're unsure whether computer science is right for you, keeping your grades up gives you the flexibility to transfer into a different program.

- If you’re planning to apply for a master’s program, strong academic performance is often a requirement.

- Many academic opportunities—like research positions, scholarships, or awards—use GPA as a first filter, often before even looking at your resume or portfolio.

- Co-op programs and internships often have minimum GPA requirements and some companies do use GPA as a screening tool in their hiring process for entry-level positions.

In these cases, grades do genuinely keep the doors open for these opportunities. So while you shouldn’t obsess over having a perfect GPA, don’t let your academics completely slide, especially if you’re keeping those doors open.

I also recommend trying to keep your grades decently high early on—even if you don’t plan to. First-year courses are usually the easiest, and doing well in them gives you a GPA cushion and builds the study habits you’ll need later. If you start off weak, it’s a lot harder to recover later when the material gets more complex and the curve gets steeper.

**In short:** do well enough early so you can afford to slack later (if you need to).
