# 3. How to Make The Most of University

University is about more than just attending classes and earning good grades. It’s one of the few times in your life where you have access to a huge range of resources, mentorship, and opportunities — all designed to help you build the foundation for your future career.

You’re investing tens of thousands of dollars and several years of your life into this experience. That’s why it’s so important to approach it with intention, rather than just going through the motions or doing the bare minimum to graduate.

To truly get the most out of your time at university, there are three major pillars you should focus on:

## Community

The people around you — your classmates, TAs, and professors — can become some of your most valuable assets. They might be your study partners, your mentors, your future coworkers, or even the ones who refer you to your first job.

Make the effort to connect. Join clubs, attend events, introduce yourself after class, and go to office hours. Some of the most useful knowledge you’ll gain during university won’t come from a lecture or textbook — it’ll come from a conversation with an upper-year student who’s been where you are, or a professor with years of industry experience.

## Opportunities

University gives you access to a wide range of opportunities that can help you build your resume, gain real-world experience, and explore different paths. These might include:

- Co-op programs
- Research positions
- Hackathons and coding competitions
- Grants and scholarships
- Volunteer and leadership roles

These aren’t just ways to pad your resume — they’re accelerators. They help you discover what excites you, build meaningful experience, and grow your network.

The biggest mistake most students make is waiting too long to get involved. Start early, and say yes often.

If you have nothing on your resume, this is the best way to start building it.

## Academics

Yes — this is the actual “school” part.

Your coursework forms the foundation of knowledge you’ll build on throughout your career. Even though grades aren’t everything, taking your courses seriously matters. This is where you develop the mental models and problem-solving skills you’ll rely on again and again — no matter what new language, framework, or technology comes along.

The key is to focus on mastering the fundamentals and learning how to learn. That’s what will allow you to adapt as technologies and paradigms change over time.
