# 3. How to Maximize University Experience

University isn’t just about lectures and exams. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime environment that gives you access to resources, people, and opportunities you’ll never have in the same way again.

To really get the most out of it, you need to think beyond just getting good grades. There are three major pillars to focus on:

## Academics

Yes—this is the actual “school” part.

The curriculum forms the platform of knowledge you’ll build on for the rest of your career. This is where you learn the fundamentals: how to think like a computer scientist, how to solve problems, how to write clean code, and how to understand the systems that power the real world.

Even though grades aren’t everything, taking your courses seriously is still important. They teach you the mental models you’ll use again and again—whether you're building side projects, preparing for technical interviews, or working in industry. Don’t just aim to pass. Aim to understand.

## Community

One of the most underrated parts of university is the community. The people around you—your classmates, TAs, and profs—can become your support system, your study group, your future coworkers, and even your referrals into jobs. These are the people who will understand what you're going through better than anyone else.

Make the effort to meet people. Join clubs. Say hi after class. Attend office hours. Some of the most valuable knowledge you’ll gain in university won’t come from a textbook—it’ll come from a fourth-year who tells you which prof to take for a specific course, or friend who got you a referal at the company they interned at.

## Opportunities

University gives you access to a ton of things that vanish the moment you graduate—things like:

- Research positions

- Internships with student-specific hiring streams

- Hackathons and competitions

- Grants and scholarships

- Volunteer and leadership roles

- Co-op programs

These aren’t just resume-padding. They’re accelerators. They help you figure out what you like, build experience, and grow your network.

The catch? Most students don’t even realize these things exist until it’s too late. So start early, and say yes often. Apply even if you’re not sure you’re qualified. You’d be surprised how far being proactive can take you.
