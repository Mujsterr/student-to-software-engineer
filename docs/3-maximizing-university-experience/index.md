# 3. How to Make The Most of University

University is more than just classes and grades. It’s a unique opportunity to build a foundation for your career.

You are paying tens of thousands of dollars for this experience, so you should get the most out of it.

you need to think beyond just getting good grades. There are three major pillars to focus on:

## Community

The people around you—your classmates, TAs, and profs—can become your support system, your study group, your future coworkers, and even your referrals into jobs.

Make the effort to meet people. Join clubs. Say hi after class. Attend office hours. Some of the most valuable knowledge you’ll gain in university won’t come from a textbook—it’ll come from a conversation with an upper-year student or a professor who’s been in the industry for decades.

## Opportunities

University gives you access to a wide range of opportunities that can help you build your resume and gain real-world experience. These can include:

- Co-op programs
- Research positions
- Internships with student-specific hiring streams
- Hackathons and competitions
- Grants and scholarships
- Volunteer and leadership roles

These aren’t just resume-padding. They’re accelerators. They help you figure out what you like, build experience, and grow your network.

Most students don’t take advantage until it’s too late. So start early, and say yes often. Apply even if you’re not sure you’re qualified. You’d be surprised how far being proactive can take you.

## Academics

Yes—this is the actual “school” part.

The curriculum forms the platform of knowledge you’ll build on for the rest of your career.

Even though grades aren’t everything, taking your courses seriously is still important. They teach you the mental models you’ll use again and again—whether instead of the "latest framework of the week".

It's crucial to understand the fundamentals and "learn how to learn" so you can adapt to new technologies and paradigms as they emerge.
