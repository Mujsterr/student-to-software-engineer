# 3.2. Join The Community

The real value of university is being able to surround yourself with a students pursuing similar goals, and an etwork of people who can help you grow.

The content of baseline undergraduate computer science courses is easily available online and not the reason your program costs tens of thousands of dollars.

The people you meet in university can become your future coworkers, mentors, and life-long friends. They can help you find internships, give you advice on projects, and even refer you to jobs later on.

**You are wasting your money if you are not:**

- Getting to know the students you're going to class with
- Meeting upper-year students
- Getting to know your professors
- Getting involved in clubs and societies
- Attending events and workshops
- Participating in hackathons and coding competitions

Whether you realize it yet or not, these are your future colleagues, mentors, and friends. Getting involved in the community is just as imporant your courses and is **the first step to landing your first job**.

## Upper-Year Students

Upper-year students are a goldmine of information.

They’ve been through the same courses you’re taking now, and they know what to expect. They can give you tips on which professors to take, which courses are worth it, and how to prepare for exams.

Get their hand-me-downs. Notes, assignments, and projects from previous years can save you time and help you understand the material better.

They can also help you understand the job market, what companies are looking for, and how to prepare for interviews. They can even refer you to internships or job opportunities they know about.

Get upper-years to review your resume. They know what works to land an internship in a way that university staff who have never worked in the industry do not.

## Professors & Teaching Staff

It's really important you know professors are people too.

This is not like highschool where your teachers are just there to teach you and give you grades. Professors are often experts in their field, and they can be a great resource for you.

It can be really hard to get to know your professors, especially in large classes, which is all the more reason you should go to events like prof nights or seminar talks. You can also go to their office hours, ask them questions about the course material, or even just chat with them about their research.

Befriending your professors can lead to research opportunities, mentorship, and even job referrals. They can also write you a letter of recommendation when you need one.

If you are in your first few years, it's unlikely your professor is teaching the subject they are most passionate about, so don't be afraid to ask them about their research interests or what they enjoy working on outside of class. This can help you build a connection with them and show that you are genuinely interested in their work.

## Clubs & Societies

Your university likely has a number of clubs and societies related to computer science, technology, and entrepreneurship, and if they don't have one, you can start your own!

Being involved with clubs is the best way to meet students not in your classes, but also students who do more than just the bare minimum to get by.

## Student Leadership

Getting involved in student leadership is more than some resume booster. It’s a chance to develop real-world skills build your network, and make a difference in your community.

Saying on your resume that "you have leadership experience" or good "communication skills" is stupid.

Instead show it by saying "I led the organization of a hackathon with 200+ participants" or "I organized a workshop on web development that had 50+ attendees".

"Leadership experience" and "communication skills" might sound like dumb buzzwords to you now, but there is real value in knowing how to divide work, delegate tasks, and communicate effectively with a team.

These are all skills that you will need in the workplace as you eventually work towards more senior roles, and you can start developing them now by getting involved in student leadership.

## Volunteer Development Experience

Technical clubs can often have projects that you can contribute to, which is a great way to build your portfolio and gain real-world experience.

You can also volunteer to help with the technical side of organizing events, such as setting up websites or building applications for the club.
