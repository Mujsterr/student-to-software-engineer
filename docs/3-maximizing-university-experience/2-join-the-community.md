# 3.2. Join the Community

The real value of university isn’t just the classes — its being able to surround yourself with a students pursuing similar goals, and a network of people who can help you grow.

Let’s be honest: the material in your undergraduate computer science courses is freely available online. It’s not the reason your degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. What you’re really paying for is access — to mentors, and peers.

The people you meet here can become your future coworkers, mentors, business partners, or lifelong friends. They’re the ones who will help you land internships, give feedback on your projects, and refer you to jobs down the line.

**You’re wasting your money if you aren’t:**

- Getting to know your classmates
- Connecting with upper-year students
- Building relationships with professors and teaching staff
- Joining clubs and societies
- Attending events, talks, and workshops
- Participating in hackathons and competitions

These relationships are just as important as your coursework.

## Upper-Year Students

Upper-year students are one of the most valuable resources you’ll find. They’ve been through the same courses, faced the same challenges, and know what works. They can offer:

- Tips on which courses and professors to choose
- Hand-me-downs like notes, assignments, and project ideas
- Advice on internships, co-ops, and the job market
- Referrals for jobs or internships
- Feedback on your resume from someone who’s been through the hiring process

Unlike university staff, upper-year students have real, recent experience with what actually gets results in the tech industry.

## Professors & Teaching Staff

Professors aren’t just here to grade you — they’re experts in their field, and many have deep industry connections. Building relationships with them can open doors to:

- Research positions
- Mentorship
- Recommendation letters
- Job referrals

It can be hard to connect with professors, especially in large classes. That’s why it’s worth going to office hours, attending prof nights, seminar talks, or simply asking about their research. Show genuine interest, and you’ll be surprised how much they’re willing to help.

## Clubs & Societies

Joining clubs and societies is one of the best ways to meet people beyond your immediate classes — especially people who go above and beyond the bare minimum.

Whether it’s a programming club, robotics team, entrepreneurship group, or something else entirely, these are the students who are building things, organizing events, and pushing themselves. And if a club you want doesn’t exist? Start one!

## Student Leadership

Student leadership isn’t just a resume booster — it’s a chance to build real skills that matter in the workplace. Forget generic claims like “strong leadership” or “good communication.” Instead, aim for experiences you can point to:

- “I led a hackathon with 200+ participants.”
- “I organized a web development workshop with 50+ attendees.”

These experiences teach you how to divide work, delegate tasks, and communicate effectively — skills that will serve you throughout your career.

## Volunteer Development Experience

Technical clubs often have projects you can contribute to — perfect for building your portfolio and gaining practical experience. You can also volunteer your skills to help with event websites, apps, or other technical needs. These experiences not only grow your abilities but also demonstrate initiative and teamwork to future employers.
