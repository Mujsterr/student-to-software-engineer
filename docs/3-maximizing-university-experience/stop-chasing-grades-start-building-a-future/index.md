# 3.1. Stop Chasing Grades, Start Building a Future

Up until this point and especially during your time in high school—you probably haven’t had to seriously ask yourself why you're doing any of this.

You got good grades because you were supposed to. Because you needed them to get into university. That was the next step. It was obvious.

But now you’re here. So… now what?

For the first time, the path ahead isn’t so clear. You're not just working toward a grade anymore. You're working toward something. But what? A degree? A job? A life?

Most students don’t stop to think about this early enough. They treat university like high school: go to class, get good grades, move on. But here’s the problem—grades don’t matter nearly as much as you think they do. Not in the way they used to.

**Just getting good grades is less than the bare minimum.** It’s not enough to get you a job in tech. In fact, it’s not even enough to get you an interview at most companies.

Everyone around you is doing the same courses as you, so you need to do more to actually stand out.

You may be getting a **As** in your courses, but in regards to the grade you would receive on your career growth, it's probably closer to a **C**.

That doesn’t mean skipping class or flunking your courses. It means rethinking what university is for. It’s no longer about just proving you’re smart on paper. It’s about building real skills, real experience, and real connections.

Once you stop chasing the highest GPA and start investing your time in the things that actually make you hireable, everything changes.
