# 2.3.1. Mass Layoffs Explained

## Impact of Mass Layoffs on Young Professionals

As industry giants cut tens of thousands of jobs, many of these displaced workers—often seasoned and highly skilled—shift their focus to smaller tech firms, startups, and mid-sized companies.

Traditionally, smaller companies have been a fertile ground for entry-level opportunities. However, with the influx of experienced professionals seeking new roles, these positions are now being filled by candidates with years of experience, leaving fewer opportunities for recent graduates.

In this period of low developer demand, seasoned professionals are willing to accept lower pay or junior titles to remain employed, further diminishing the chances for new graduates to secure their first job.

Additionally, in a world with so many full-time layoffs, it’s extremely difficult for companies to justify hiring interns.

Internships are often seen as a way to build a pipeline of future talent, but due to economic uncertainty, companies are prioritizing immediate survival over long-term planning.

This further narrows the path for students and recent graduates, who rely on internships as a critical step toward securing full-time employment.
