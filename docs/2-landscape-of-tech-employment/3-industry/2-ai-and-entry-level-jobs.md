# 2.3.2. AI’s Impact on Entry-Level Jobs

The reality is that AI does not fully replace developers—at least, not yet.

Today, AI is simple a tool that saves developers time, kind of like how a calculator saves time in performing complex calculations. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow survey, 81% of developers agree that AI significantly boosts productivity [7].

Although it does not fully replace the duties of an entry level developer, it is able to generate code that could have previously been delegated to interns or new grad level employees.

While AI isn’t replicating the exact work developers do, its ability to enhance efficiency means that if developers become x% more productive with AI, companies may start considering reducing their developer headcount by a similar margin.
