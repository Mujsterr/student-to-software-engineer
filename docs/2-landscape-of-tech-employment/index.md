# 2. Why It’s So Hard to Get Hired

The reason it’s so hard to get a junior developer job is actually quite simple.

It comes down to two notions:

1. Fewer people are needed to build software products.

2. More people are looking for jobs than ever before.

## Why Does It Take Fewer Developers to Build in 2025?

As the tech industry has matured, the tools and frameworks available to developers have become more powerful and efficient. This means that fewer developers are needed to build a product than in the past.

Recent advancements in AI have even furthered this acceleration. Although LLMs aren't completely replacing developers, it is giving them a significant boost in productivity.

If every developer is now 20% more productive with AI, **then a team of 4 can now do the work of a team of 5**.

## Why Are There More Developers?

Enrollment in computer science programs has surged over the past two decades, leading to more new graduates entering the job market than ever before.

At the same time, recent waves of tech layoffs have displaced many experienced developers—who are now competing for roles that might have otherwise gone to entry-level candidates.

Meaning all these new graduates have little a significantly more difficult time landing a job.

## Developers Used To Be In Demand

Not so long ago, things were actually the opposite of how they are now.

There used to be fewer developers than the market wanted, and companies were willing to do whatever it took to get the best talent.

Especially in 2021, when the entire world went online, we saw a significant increase in demand for software developers. However, that promptly ended as the pandemic subsided and economic conditions shifted. Rising interest rates, reduced consumer spending, and overhiring during the boom years forced many companies to scale back. The tech industry shifted from a period of hyper-growth and aggressive hiring to one of cost-cutting, layoffs, and renewed focus on efficiency over headcount.

<!-- ## The Bigger Picture

Obviously, the explanation above only scratches the surface.

As you'll read in the proceeding sections, I believe  -->

### 1. Misunderstanding What CS Actually Is

Computer science is often mistaken for job training when it’s really an academic discipline. Many students enter the field thinking it will automatically make them employable in tech. But CS is closer to mathematics than it is to software engineering, and the degree alone doesn’t teach students how to build real-world systems or work in industry roles.

This confusion isn’t entirely their fault. Tech is still new, and society hasn’t caught up with the variety of roles it offers. Students aren’t taught the difference between software development, data science, DevOps, or cybersecurity. As a result, they graduate with a solid theoretical foundation—but little sense of direction, and even less applied experience.

### 2. Universities Are Producing Weaker Graduates

The explosion in enrollment has overwhelmed universities, leading to larger classes, fewer faculty, and watered-down assessments. COVID-19 stripped away years of hands-on learning and community-building, and AI tools like ChatGPT have made it easier than ever to pass courses without mastering the material.

At the same time, students now enter with wildly different backgrounds. Some have been coding for years. Others have never used a file system or installed software. But instead of adapting, most universities still follow a rigid, one-size-fits-all curriculum. Experienced students become bored and disengaged. Inexperienced students fall behind and struggle in silence.

The result? Students graduating today are less prepared than ever to meet the demands of real world jobs.

### 3. The Job Market Has Collapsed for New Grads

Just as students are struggling to gain real experience, the opportunities to do so are disappearing.

Entry-level hiring has slowed dramatically. Mass layoffs have pushed experienced developers into junior roles, internships are harder to justify when budgets are tight, and AI has begun to automate the kinds of tasks that used to be reserved for beginners. -->
