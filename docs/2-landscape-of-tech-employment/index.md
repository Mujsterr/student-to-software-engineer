# 2. Why It’s So Hard to Get Hired

The reason it’s so hard to get a junior developer job is actually quite simple.

It comes down to two notions:

1. Fewer developers are needed to build products.

2. More people are looking for jobs than ever before.

## Why does it take fewer developers to build in 2025?

As the tech industry has matured, the tools and frameworks available to developers have become more powerful and efficient. This means that fewer developers are needed to build a product than in the past.

Recent advancements in AI have even furthered this acceleration. Although LLMs aren't completely replacing developers, it is giving them a significant boost in productivity.

If every developer is now 20% more productive with AI, **then a team of 4 can now do the work of a team of 5**.

## Why are there more developers?

Enrollment in computer science programs has surged over the past two decades, leading to more new graduates entering the job market than ever before.

At the same time, recent waves of tech layoffs have displaced many experienced developers—who are now competing for roles that might have otherwise gone to entry-level candidates.

Meaning all these new graduates have little to no chance of getting a job.

<!-- ## The Bigger Picture

The explanation above offers a solid starting point—but it only scratches the surface.

There are deeper forces at play that make today’s job market especially hostile to new graduates. And some of those forces are uncomfortable to talk about. But if you want to understand what you’re up against—and what to do about it—you need the full picture.

### A Lack of Societal Understanding of What Computer Science Is

Computer science is still a relatively young field, and as a result, it’s often misunderstood by the general public and the by students entering the program.

The public perception of computer science is that it is synonymous with programming. But computer science is a theoretical discipline, not a job description. It’s more like mathematics or physics than it is like plumbing or accounting.

This misunderstanding leads thousands of students to enter CS programs without a clear idea of what they’re actually studying or what kind of career they’re preparing for. They believe that simply getting a CS degree is enough to secure a job in tech. But that was only ever true during periods of explosive hiring, and it’s no longer the case.

Students who do not understand the field they’re entering are at a disadvantage from the start. They do not know what is or isn't important to learn, and do not take advantage of everything university has to offer.

### Universities Are Producing Graduates Who Are Increasingly Less Capable

At the same time that tech is becoming more competitive, many university programs are falling behind.

The rise in enrollment hasn’t been matched by a rise in teaching resources. Instructors and TAs are overburdened, lectures are overcrowded, and assignments are often simplified to make them easier to mark—not to maximize student learning.

COVID-19 only worsened this trend, stripping away years of in-person learning, peer mentorship, and community-building. And the sudden availability of tools like ChatGPT has made it easier than ever for students to complete assignments without understanding the material.

The result? A growing percentage of CS grads don’t have the skills needed to contribute to real-world software teams.

It’s not that students are lazy or incapable—it’s that they’re being pushed through a system that no longer guarantees competence. And the industry is noticing.

### The Tech Industry Is Destroying the Entry-Level Job Market

Meanwhile, the tech industry itself has become less friendly to junior developers.

During the early 2010s and especially the 2020 pandemic boom, companies were hiring aggressively. There was a surplus of funding, and tech talent was hard to come by. That era is over.

Today, hiring is slower, more cautious, and more selective. Internships are harder to justify when companies are laying off full-time staff. Entry-level roles are flooded with applicants. And when experienced developers are willing to take junior positions just to stay employed, guess who gets pushed out?

Even worse, the rise of AI is starting to encroach on the kind of work that used to go to interns and new grads. Tasks like writing boilerplate code, fixing simple bugs, or building minor features can now be partially or fully automated. These were the exact tasks junior developers used to cut their teeth on.

The bar for entry-level roles is rising to a level that is increasingly out of reach for what graduates and self-taught developers can do on their own without real-world experience. -->
