# 2. Understanding the Hiring Gap

Once seen as a gateway to a “guaranteed job,” computer science has recently become a seemingly less secure path for students and recent graduates.

Just a few years ago, landing a software development internship seemed straightforward—being likable, eager to learn, and maybe having a personal project would often be enough to get you in the door.

However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, skyrocketing enrollment in university computer science programs, and rapid advancement in AI have all converged to reshape the job market.

Though these factors might seem remote and out of students’ hands, there’s an unsettling reality that has been widely ignored: despite the broad availability of technology, the average capability of students remains unchanged—or may even be declining.

From my experience as a student at Carleton University, I believe it’s more than just the changing job market that has made the journey from student to software engineer more challenging—it’s the impact of overcrowded university classrooms, weakened student communities, and impact of AI on education that have all contributed to this decline.

Additionally, many computer science students misunderstand how computer science actually connects to the tech industry, confusing it with applications like software engineering or data science. This disconnect leaves them unprepared for industry demands and confused at why having only a computer science background may not be enough to find a job.
