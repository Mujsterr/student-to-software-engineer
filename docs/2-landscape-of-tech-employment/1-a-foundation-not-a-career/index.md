# 2.1. Computer Science is a Foundation, Not a Career

A key reason many computer science students are struggling to find employment is due to a lack of understanding of what computer science actually is.

Unlike more traditional careers—such as becoming a doctor or lawyer—where the path and end goal are well understood from a young age, computer science is newer and far less familiar to the general public. Most students enter the program with little more than the idea that they “want to code,” but don’t fully understand what that entails or where it leads.

## Computer Science Is Not Employable By Default

While a computer science degree provides a critical foundation, it does not, on its own, make students employable in the tech industry. The degree focuses heavily on theory—data structures, algorithms, computability—but stops short of teaching the practical, job-specific skills required for most industry roles.

Although there are many jobs in tech, the vast majority are for roles like **Software Developers**, **Data Scientists**, **Security Analysts**, and **Site Reliability Engineers**—not “Computer Scientists.”

This is an important distinction. Computer science is the _foundation_ of many of these roles in the same way that math is the foundation of physics, and physics is the foundation of chemistry. But just as knowing calculus doesn’t make someone an engineer, knowing how to write a sorting algorithm doesn’t make someone a professional software developer.

## What Software Developers Actually Do

The best way to understand the difference is through analogy. As a software developer, I often describe my job as being like a mechanic.

A mechanic builds and repairs cars using familiar components like engines, wheels, and brakes. Similarly, software developers build applications by stitching together well-known components like databases, user interfaces, APIs, and cloud infrastructure.

A **computer scientist**, on the other hand, is more like someone who invents better engines or discovers a new way to make tires. They work on foundational tools and techniques that others use to build systems.

Most CS students today graduate without even knowing what these software “components” are. They don’t understand how a full application is assembled, how data flows from the frontend to the backend, or how to use real-world tools like Git, Docker, or SQL effectively.

## Why That’s a Problem

Think of it like this:

> A software developer who doesn’t know the components of software is like a mechanic who doesn’t know what parts make up a car.

This problem extends beyond software development. It also affects students who want to enter fields like AI, cybersecurity, networking, or systems administration. Without hands-on knowledge of the systems and tools these fields rely on, students remain unprepared to contribute in real jobs.

## The Degree Is a Starting Point

To succeed in today’s job market, students must treat their computer science degree as a starting point, not a complete path to employment. Understanding how computer science connects to actual careers—and filling in the gaps with practical experience—is what turns a student into a competitive job applicant.
