# 2.2. State of Academia

While the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of AI have undoubtedly reshaped education, many of the issues in computer science education were already well underway. CS programs, in particular, have become increasingly overcrowded over the past decade.

In both the U.S. and Canada, the number of undergraduate computer science majors tripled in the decade following 2005, and it has only continued to grow. At Carleton University, for example, the number of undergraduate CS students increased from 998 in 2013 to 2,791 in 2023.

However, this growth has not been matched by a proportional increase in faculty. The number of full-time instructors—particularly tenure-track professors—has remained relatively stagnant, placing increasing strain on the teaching capacity of departments.

Adding to the complexity, CS programs must now accommodate a far wider range of incoming student backgrounds. Some students arrive with years of programming experience; others have never written a single line of code.

This diversity in experience, combined with enrollment pressures and limited teaching resources, has had serious consequences for the quality of education, student engagement, and career readiness.
