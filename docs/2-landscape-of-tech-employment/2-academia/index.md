# 2.2. State of Academia

The rapid growth in enrollment in undergraduate computer science programs has outpaced the resources available to support students, leading to overcrowded classrooms, limited faculty attention, and a decline in the quality of education.

This mixed with COVID-19 disruptions and the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has created a perfect storm that is making it increasingly difficult for students to get the education they need to succeed in the tech industry.

To add more complexity, university programs must now accommodate a broader range of prior programming experience.

The increasing simplification of technology for everyday consumers has led to a surge in students with limited tech literacy entering these programs. Additionally, there is a sizeable subset of students who are enrolling primarily for financial incentives rather than out of genuine interest. The influx of less capable and less motivated students is adding a strain on resources and bringing down the quality of the experience for those who are genuinely passionate.

To cope with these overpopulated classrooms, university programs are often forced to opt for course assessments that prioritize minimizing marking time over giving students creative freedom or meaningful feedback; this diminishes the quality of the university experience and leaves students less prepared for the job market.
