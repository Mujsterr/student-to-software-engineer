# 2.2.1 Widening Spectrum of Entrance Experience

While technology is more present in everyday life than ever before, the actual technical experience of students entering computer science programs has become increasingly polarized.

Some students arrive with years of programming experience, having built games, web apps, or completed online courses. Others have never written a single line of code and have little to no familiarity with basic computing concepts.

And while this has always been the case to some extent, the gap has widened significantly in recent years thanks to the rise of simplified tech like iPads and Chromebooks, which have become common as early as elementary school.

## No Standardized Starting Line

Part of the issue stems from the fact that there is no universal or standardized high school curriculum for computer science.

Across North America, some high schools offer AP Computer Science or teach Python and Java as early as Grade 10, while others offer no programming instruction whatsoever.

Similarly, while programs like the International Baccalaureate (IB) or Advanced Placement (AP) exist, they are not universally recognized. Even students who complete these advanced high school courses often find that universities do not allow them to skip introductory material.

The result is a fragmented pipeline: incoming university students might have vastly different levels of experience, and yet unless they go to one of the best schools on the continent, they are forced into a one-size-fits-all curriculum with few options for acceleration.

## Increased Lack of Tech Literacy

As a student mentor at Carleton University, I frequently meet first-year CS students who:

- Have never used Windows or interacted with a file system
- Don’t know how to install software or troubleshoot basic issues
- Grew up using only Chromebooks, iPads, or locked-down school laptops

Whereas I was introduced to concepts like files and executables in elementary school, the increase of simplified tech like iPads and Chromebooks has led to a generation of students who lack a good deal of foundational knowledge.

This lack of foundational literacy creates a cascading effect:

- Students struggle with basic tooling, slowing down their ability to pick up programming skills
- They avoid extracurriculars like coding competitions or clubs, seeing them as too advanced
- They lack the confidence or ability to build side projects—key experiences for internship applications

And while most computer science programs are designed with the assumption that students have no prior programming experience, they are rarely designed to handle students with no practical computing experience at all. Many courses continue to assume students understand basic ideas like files, directories, or how to use a terminal, when a growing portion of students do not.

## Experienced Students Are Systematically Held Back

Ironically, the opposite problem also exists. Technological accessibility has allowed many students to gain significant programming experience before entering university—having built games, web apps, or completed online courses at even earlier ages than ever before.

But because most university programs are built on the assumption of limited prior experience, all students—regardless of skill—are forced to start from the beginning.

This creates several problems:

- Advanced students sit through “kindergarten-level” courses that feel like a waste of time
- They become disengaged, skipping lectures or doing the bare minimum to pass
- They develop bad habits—overconfidence, laziness, ego, or resentment toward the program

The ability to skip early courses or take accelerated paths is often limited or non-existent.

## Lack of Acceleration in Canada

In Canada, only the University of British Columbia (UBC) offers a placement exam that allows students to test out of introductory courses. Most other universities, including Waterloo—which is widely considered the top CS school in the country—only “strongly encourage” experienced students to take advanced introductory courses (e.g. CS 145 instead of CS 135). However, CS 145 is not a true acceleration path, it advertises that it covers the same material with only a more theoretical framing.

Many of these students could be thriving if offered higher-level electives earlier or given opportunities to accelerate—but few programs offer formal pathways for this. As a result, high-potential students often go unchallenged and unsupported, drifting through their degree without any clear direction on how to continue growing.

## Acceleration in the United States

In the United States, there are slightly more options—but they vary dramatically from school to school.

Some top universities accept AP Computer Science as a way to skip introductory CS courses. Others offer their own internal placement tests during orientation or in the summer prior to enrollment.

For example:

- **MIT** allows students to bypass introductory CS courses through placement exams or by demonstrating competency via prior coursework or projects.
- **Stanford** provides placement diagnostics and gives credit for AP scores, though they often still recommend that students take their introductory series to align with the rest of the curriculum.
- **UC Berkeley** accepts AP credit but does not allow it to substitute core CS major requirements, encouraging students to retake the material in more depth.
- **Harvard** offers accelerated versions of intro courses (e.g. CS50x) but doesn't formally exempt students from prerequisites unless reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

However, outside of these top-tier schools, many universities still do not offer robust acceleration options. Students with significant prior experience often find themselves stuck in introductory courses that do not challenge them or help them grow.
