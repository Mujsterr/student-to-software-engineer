# 2.2.1. Increasing Lack of Tech Literacy

One surprising trend is that despite tech being more present in daily life, many students are entering computer science programs **with less technical experience than ever before**.

At Carleton, it’s now common to meet first-year CS students who:

- Have never used Windows or a file system
- Don’t know how to install software on their own
- Have only ever used iPads or Chromebooks

These students often lack foundational knowledge that instructors assume they have. Compared to peers with even a year of programming experience, they may be **a full academic year behind**.

This sets off a chain reaction:

- They choose less demanding course loads
- They don’t have time for extracurriculars, side projects, or student leadership
- They miss out on activities that strengthen internship applications

And while universities have historically assumed students come in with little programming experience, many have not yet adapted to this even lower baseline of tech literacy.
