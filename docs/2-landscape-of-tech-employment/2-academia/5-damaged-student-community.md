# 2.2.5. Damaged Student Community

University isn’t just about classes—it’s also about community. And in tech, **community is often where careers are launched**.

COVID disrupted one of the most valuable parts of the university experience: the informal peer-to-peer advice networks that pass down career strategies, resume tips, and survival guides from upper years to first years.

Upper-year students often serve as:

- Mentors for internships and co-ops
- Guides on which professors to take or avoid
- Referrers to job opportunities and companies

These casual relationships have tangible effects. For example, I only landed my first paid tech job because upper-year students made it clear that it was _possible_, and helped me figure out how to get there. Before that, I thought I’d be lucky to get an unpaid volunteer role.

But students who started in **Fall 2020 and 2021** missed this entirely. When they returned in-person in Fall 2022, the students who had those experiences were graduating or gone. This created a knowledge vacuum—one that hasn’t been fully refilled.

Some students have never even heard advice as basic as “add personal projects to your resume,” and that’s left them less prepared to compete in today’s job market.
