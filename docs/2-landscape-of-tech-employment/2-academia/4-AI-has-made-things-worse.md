# 2.2.4. AI’s Educational Shift

While the rise of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer new learning opportunities, it has also made _“cheating”_ more accessible and widespread than ever before.

Assignments that were already simplified to accommodate overcrowded classes and limited TA support—multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, auto-graded code problems—are now trivial to solve using AI.

Students are increasingly relying on AI to do their assignments for them, often without any real understanding of the material. This is not just a problem of academic integrity; it’s a fundamental issue of learning and skill development.

Like it or not, tools like ChatGPT are here to stay. And just like calculators were eventually accepted in math education, universities must evolve rather than resist.

But the reality is that many universities are struggling to adapt. They cling to outdated assessment methods, failing to recognize that the traditional model of education is no longer effective in the age of AI.
