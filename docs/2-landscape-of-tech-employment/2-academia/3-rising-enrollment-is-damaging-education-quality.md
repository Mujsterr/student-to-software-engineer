# 2.2.3. Overcrowding Hurts Education

Across North America, computer science programs have tripled in size between 2005 and 2015 and have continued to grow since then. At Carleton University, for example, the number of undergraduate CS students increased from 998 in 2013 to 2,791 in 2023.

Meanwhile, the increase in the number of tenure-track faculty and teaching faculty in no way matches the growth in the number of undergraduate CS majors.
