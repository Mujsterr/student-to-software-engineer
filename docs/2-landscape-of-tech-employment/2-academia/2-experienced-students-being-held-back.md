# 2.2.2. Experienced Students Are Held Back

Ironically, the opposite problem also exists. Many students **do** arrive with significant programming experience—having built games, web apps, or completed online courses.

But because most university programs are built on the assumption of **zero prior experience**, all students—regardless of skill—are forced to start from the beginning.

This means experienced students are:

- Stuck in “kindergarten-level” intro courses
- Relearning material they already know
- Bored, unmotivated, and disengaged

This can lead to complacency, skipping classes, bad habits, and in some cases, feeling like the degree isn’t worth the cost. Few programs offer acceleration paths, and large class sizes prevent more advanced students from being challenged.
