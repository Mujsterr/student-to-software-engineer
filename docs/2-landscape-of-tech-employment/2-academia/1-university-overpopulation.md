# 2.2.1. Too Many Students, Too Few Educators

A key reason there are so many new developers looking for employment is because the number of computer science graduates has skyrocketed over the past two decades.

Enrollment in computer science has surged, but the number of educators hasn’t kept pace. As a result, students face larger class sizes, less support, and a learning environment that often prioritizes logistics over growth.

## North American Enrollment Numbers

The average number of undergraduate CS majors at universities in the U.S. and Canada tripled in the decade after 2005, and it’s only continued to grow. At Carleton University, we’ve seen the program’s population triple from 998 in 2013 to 2791 in 2023.

Here are the student enrollment numbers for the most well-known computer science programs in Canada:

| University             | 2013      | 2023      |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Carleton University    | 998       | 2,791     |
| UBC                    | 1,288     | 2,774     |
| University of Waterloo | ~3,600    | ~5,400    |
| University of Toronto  | ~500/year | ~500/year |
| UC Berkeley            | ~1,500    | 2,022     |
| MIT                    | ~1,000    | 961       |
| Stanford University    | ~300      | ~700      |
| Harvard University     | ~100      | 184       |

**Notes:**

- **MIT**: In 2023, the number of undergraduates in the Computer Science and Engineering (VI-3) program was 661, and in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making (VI-4) was 300, totaling 961 students. ([registrar.mit.edu][8])

- **Stanford University**: The CS major is the largest undergraduate major at Stanford. ([cs.stanford.edu][9])

- **Harvard University**: In the academic year 2023–2024, Harvard conferred 184 degrees in Computer Science. ([oira.harvard.edu][10])

These figures illustrate the significant growth in CS undergraduate enrollment across major U.S. universities over the past decade.

## Faculty Numbers Aren’t Keeping Up

While student numbers have exploded, the number of computer science educators hasn’t kept pace.

According to the **Computing Research Association’s Taulbee Survey**, undergraduate enrollment in CS more than tripled from 2006 to 2021, but the number of tenure-track faculty only grew by around 30% during that time [11].

This faculty bottleneck leads to overloaded classrooms and limited support. The **National Academies of Sciences** observed that introductory CS courses at large universities often enroll 300–800 students in a single class with minimal teaching assistance [12].

To cope, universities lean on multiple-choice exams and auto-graded coding assignments. These simplify grading at scale but offer little feedback or challenge. It also means students rarely have space to ask questions, receive mentorship, or explore topics beyond the syllabus.

## Why Overcrowding Hurts Learning

Education research strongly supports what students already feel: smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes.

- A **meta-analysis by the National Education Policy Center** found that smaller classes boost both achievement and engagement—especially for first-generation and lower-income students [13].
- The **Tennessee STAR experiment**, a landmark randomized study, found that students in smaller classes performed better and were more likely to pursue postsecondary education [14].
- The **OECD’s Education at a Glance 2023** confirmed that quality learning requires time, attention, and dialogue—things in short supply in packed CS lectures [15].

In CS, where trial-and-error and hands-on support are vital, a high student-to-faculty ratio makes it nearly impossible to properly teach or assess key skills like debugging, problem decomposition, or system design.

## Teaching Quality is Stretched Thin

As computer science enrollment has grown without a corresponding increase in faculty, the surge has strained resources, particularly in first- and second-year courses, where large class sizes have become the norm.

At Carleton University, all required computer science courses from first to third year have anywhere from 75-100 students to register per section, with multiple sections for most courses.

At Carleton, most students won’t attend a computer science class with fewer than 100 students until third or even forth year of a four-year program. In my first year, the mandatory course “COMP 1405: Introduction to Computer Science” had three sections of over 100 students each; as of 2024, it has expanded to five sections.

In response to these pressures, the nature of assignments and exams for these classes have continued to become increasingly prescriptive. To handle the sheer volume of students, faculty design tasks that are straight forward for teaching assistants to grade and require giving students limited feedback; sacrificing the quality of learning for the sake of manageability.

To patch over the shortage of faculty, Carleton resorts to letting undergraduates, some as early as their second year, become teaching assistants purely based on grades, without any interviews to gauge their teaching ability or communication skills.

The result of rigid assesments is that students not only miss out on developing critical thinking skills and original ideas about computer science, but they also struggle to distinguish their university education from their high school experience or what they are able to access for free online.

Especially with the pandemic leading to more recorded lectures, the reality is that for introductory level courses, there are hundreds of free better produced pieces of educational content already accesible online. A great example of this would be Harvard’s CS50, a free online introductory computer science course.

The lack of depth and engagement in coursework leaves students unable to fully appreciate the value of higher education, diminishing their ability to make the most of their university years.

Without opportunities to explore and challenge ideas, students may leave university unprepared for the complexities of the real world, and most will graduate today without ever having had an original idea about the field.
