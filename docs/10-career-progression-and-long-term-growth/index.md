# 10. How To Progress Towards Senior

You landed the full-time job, but now what?

## 10.1 Understand What “Senior” Really Means

A Senior Developer is more than just a good coder. It’s someone who can:

- Design and deliver end-to-end solutions with minimal oversight
- Make thoughtful tradeoffs between speed, cost, and maintainability
- Unblock others through mentorship or code reviews
- Communicate effectively with stakeholders, not just teammates
- Anticipate edge cases and failure scenarios before they become real problems
- Take initiative on things that aren’t "assigned" to them

## 10.2 Stop Waiting for Assignments

A junior developer waits for tickets. A senior developer sees problems and proposes solutions.

Look for broken processes, flaky tests, confusing documentation, or unnecessary complexity — then fix them or start the conversation. Ask yourself regularly: “Is there something I could improve that would help the whole team?”

## 10.3 Learn the Business

You’ll accelerate your career by understanding how your company actually makes money. What are the core metrics? Who are the users? What are customers willing to pay for?

Senior engineers understand the "why" behind the product. They know how their work ties into the company’s goals and can make smart technical choices that reflect business priorities.

## 10.4 Own Your Career Growth

Finally, don’t assume your manager is tracking everything you do. Keep notes on what you ship, how you helped others, and what you learned. Ask what the expectations are for a senior title at your company. Find out how people have been promoted in the past. Don’t be afraid to ask for a path — or switch teams if you’ve hit a ceiling.
